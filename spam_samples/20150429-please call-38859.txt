Hi Liz, Its Matt. I know its been awhile. How have you been?

I've been wanting to let you in on some great news. It's about money that is available for college in your State .

The amount is $5,730* if you qualify and doesn't need to be paid back.

This money is from Gov't Grant Programs and it can be used for online classes as well.

You can choose to have it direct deposited into your account or get a check.

It takes like 2 minutes to see if you qualify.

Thank you,
Matt
