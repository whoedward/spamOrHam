Hey all,

It's finally time to do our midyear eval sitdowns. It will take between fifteen and thirty minutes, you WILL get paid, and it will be super fun.

I'm free:

Sundays All Day
Mondays 9-12 & 2-8
Tuesdays 1-8
Wednesdays 9-12 & 12-8
Thursdays 6-8
Fridays 9-12 & 6-8
Saturdays All Day

If we have a shift together, that is an option. Otherwise, let me know when you are available and we can work something out.

Best,
Ethan
