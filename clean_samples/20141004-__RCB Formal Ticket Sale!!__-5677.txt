Hello ISRC!

I'm excited to announce that tickets for the RCB Formal are now officially on sale. 

The formal is again on Nov. 14th, starting at 8pm. Tickets are $15. 

I will be selling tickets at 8pm on Sundays, before Open Exec. I will be in the ISRC Library, so stop by with your money and I will put your name down. Ticket sales will be going on for the next several weeks, so don't worry if you don't buy it right away. 

For non-res's, if you wish to buy a ticket, and can't make it to ISRC on Sunday nights, please email me at estebandoyle2017@u.northwestern.edu, and we can arrange another time to collect the money. 

You are allowed to bring a date/guest who is not in a Residential College, however he/she must pay $35 for the ticket. 

Any questions, don't hesitate to ask. 

Attach is a picture from Facebook of past ISRC members at the formal last year.

ISRCLove,
Esteban
