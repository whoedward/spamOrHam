Hi Ethan,

Sorry to say, but the guitars are currently not for sale (Debra the manager is not ready to sell them yet, but we might in the future. probably next quarter?)  

Regards,

    Hi Isaac,

    Do the Rock Band games include a controller? If so, I would like the first.

    Best,

        Hello!

        I hope everyone is having a wonderful reading week! The Game Room is happy to announce a used game and equipment sale.  Please view the linked Google Doc and reply with whichever games you would like to buy.  First come; first serve!  Once you've gotten a confirmation from me, you'll be able to pay and pick up the game from the Game Room on Friday, March 13th. Good luck with studying for finals!
