Hey ISRC,

I'm going to tell you about important social things coming up.

First, we have RCB formal. This will be Saturday, October 26. This will be a dance at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. There will appetizers and some floors of the museum will be open. It will be a lot of fun and your friends from other RCs will be there as well. Tickets are $20. I'm going to be posting a sign up sheet, or you can tell me in person.

Second, is suite munchies. Starting next week you will be in charge of getting munchies. The food should work with your country theme and you will have a budget of $150. I will notify you when it is your week so you can collaborate with your suite. Just remember if you need help, talk to me or other exec. We can also get you your tax exempt form. I will email you a link to the schedule.

Thanks for reading this email. I know it was thrilling.

Jonas
