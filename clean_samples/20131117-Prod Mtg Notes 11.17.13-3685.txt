General Notes:

·      Please read rehearsal reports!

·    Matt will be reaching out to designers beginning the week of the 25th about budget

·    Need to ask about fog in Shanley—is this okay?

Set Notes:

    Goal: set to seem solid and real throughout first act, crumble during second
    Clear idea for a sigil for Caesar
    We have a ground plan! Several key elements: arch made of scaffolding, several levels
    Barriers will be onstage throughout first act, will be moved around and used to create a more dynamic space

Prop Notes:

    We have a props list!
    Bullet belts—relatively cheap on Amazon
    Riot shields? Real life or improvised?

Costume Notes:

    Several inspiration images
    Specific image for soothsayer—homeless, vagabond look
    Maia, Jessica and assistants will be having a conversation soon

Light Notes:

    Illumination vs. lack of illumination
    Silhouetting and contouring—no light vs. light
    Lights etching out the human forms onstage
    Color/light ambience—will need to have a discussion with costumes and props to talk about coloring

Sound Notes:

    Chant for mob—will first be starting when Caesar turns down crown
    Possibly a chant for Brutus?
    Thunderstorm elements—lion roar sounds will be modified to sound like thunder
    Crackle for fire in the background during thunderstorms
    Would like wind during thunderstorms to sound ghostly
    End of Act I sounds were awesome!
    During Antony’s speech at end of Act I—mic for Antony, will have reverb to sound like a bigger space

Publicity/Marketing Notes:

    Designs meant to look like street signs
    Final poster: hybrid between WWII propaganda poster modern Shepard Fairey modern-day propaganda

Fundraising Notes:

    First event coming up: gift wrapping at Barnes and Noble during reading week! Holiday shoppers come in, we can solicit donations from people we gift wrap for--will be sending out a sign-up for this 
    Dec. 4: planning Caesar Roast with student groups

Blood Notes:

    Second half of the show—blood will look more grimy
    Retractable knives are about $2 online—will hopefully be possible
    Will start working with different blood “recipes” soon to test out texture

Miscellaneous Notes:

    We have an awesome, large, diverse prod team WOO!
