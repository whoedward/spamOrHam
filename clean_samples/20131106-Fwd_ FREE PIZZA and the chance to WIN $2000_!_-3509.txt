Planning on taking the MCAT?
DON'T want to pay the full price on a course?
Come to our MCAT live auction where you can bid on an MCAT course  
WORTH OVER $2,000!!!
The bidding starts at just $50, meaning you could potentially purchase an entire course for just a fraction of the price!
There will be lots of other fun raffles going on, and more importantly... 
FREE PIZZA FOR ALL

What have you got to lose?!
Come out this Thursday November 7th @ 7:30 PM in Tech L361

This event is FREE for UPS members and just $5 for non-UPS members!
Hosted by the Undergraduate Premedical Society
