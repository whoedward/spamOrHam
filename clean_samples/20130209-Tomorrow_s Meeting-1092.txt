We have elections for the officer positions in my fraternity tomorrow, so they are starting our normal meeting much earlier at 2:00. This is obviously in conflict with our meeting. Would it be possible for us to meet at 12:30 (or anytime int he morning)? Otherwise I won't be able to make it. Also we should get an agenda made soon for it.
Enjoy the night guys!
