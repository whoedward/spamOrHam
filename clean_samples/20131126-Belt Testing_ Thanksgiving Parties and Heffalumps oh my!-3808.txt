Hi everyone,

First off, for those who are belt testing, remember the date is Sunday December 8th,
 starting at 11AM.  If you can come and help set up starting at 10AM, that would  be great too.  We expect the test to last roughly 4-5 hours.  Bring some work if you want.  There will be downtime.

I've attached two applications to this email.  The first one is the belt test application for color belts.  The second one is the application for black belts who are pretesting (this form is really light, sorry =(  it's BTMA's printer, not mine).  You will need to bring it, as well as the testing fee (which you can find on the application), to the belt test.  More information about what to bring and what to expect at the belt test will come later.

Secondly, for those of you who are staying over the Thanksgiving holidays, who would be interested in another board game night at my place over the Thanksgiving weekend?  Let's say Saturday?  Email me if you'd be interested.

Thirdly, here is a picture of a heffalump.  Enjoy!

Good luck to everyone still studying for exams and have a great Thanksgiving!

Allan
