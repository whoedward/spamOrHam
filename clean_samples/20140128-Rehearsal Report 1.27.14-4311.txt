Hey guys! Thanks for another really productive day. Almost all of these notes were discussed post-run through tonight, so don't worry. This is just official documentation of the notes that we went over. 

One last question--if anyone has hair gel that they would be willing to donate, could you please let me know? If you can't bring it to the space tomorrow, I could pick it up from you. 

Thanks!

Rehearsal Notes:

    We worked through the entire show, fixing most entrance and exit problems. Most of the blocking changes that were made today will stay as they are. If there needs to be any tweaking done tomorrow for purposes of lighting or costume changes, we will try to fix them quickly.
    We will be finishing paper tech tomorrow afternoon in time for Q2Q at night.

Scenery Notes:

    We need to ensure the edges of the paper maché are safe—gaff tape will be used copiously pre-rehearsal tomorrow.

Prop Notes:

    Things that are happening tomorrow: flask, book, set dressing, papers for assorted scenes
    Wine for Wednesday

Costume Notes:

    Things that need to be tried on tomorrow: pants for Taylor, pants for David, shoes for David, armbands
    Iron all items that need to be ironed
    Move stickers to other place on shoes
