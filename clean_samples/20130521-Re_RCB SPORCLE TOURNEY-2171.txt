Hey everyone!

There's an error in this email. The SPORCLE TOURNAMENT is on MAY 27th (Memorial Day), not the 21st (today). Sorry for the confusion!

    Whether the answer is yes or no, you and up to two RC friends should sign up for the RCB SPORCLE TOURNEY, this MONDAY MAY 21 (Memorial Day, no class. WOOOO!).

    Compete in a bracket against teams from other RCs for giftcards to Amazon and ThinkGeek. All competitors get free Giordano's Pizza. 

    Register HERE and RSVP to the Facebook event HERE
