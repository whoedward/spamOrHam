Hello awesome people,

If you are coming to Saturday practice tomorrow, please bring your sparring gear if you have it. We may not have enough spare sets of chest protectors if people don't bring their own gear. The next three Saturday practices will be devoted primarily to preparing for the Purdue tournament on October 10th, so it's vital for anyone planning to compete to come to practice. And if you're not going to compete, come to practice anyway! We don't usually do sparring practices on weekdays, especially in the first quarter, so it's a good opportunity to see what sparring is about and experience a very different set of training drills. For many people (myself included), sparring and sparring training is the best part of Taekwondo.

There will be a separate email sent out tomorrow with more detailed information about the Purdue tournament. For now, if you are a yellow belt or above considering entering the tournament for sparring, please do not miss the Saturday practices until the tournament.

Finally, Saturday practices are no uniform. You are welcome to wear your uniform to practice if you'd like, else feel free to wear whatever is most comfortable for you (which would be my pajamas for me, no joke).

Don't forget to pay dues and uniform money if you haven't already!

Ji-hoon
