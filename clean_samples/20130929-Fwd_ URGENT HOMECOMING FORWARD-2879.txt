Hi everyone!

Here's a fun event that is happening this week (i.e. TOMORROW)! Hope you all have great weekends!

ISRCLove,

-------------------------------------------------

Come play Homecoming Hunt! 

Search campus for different locations worth different points.  Find as many as you can in two hours.  Winners will get signed athletic posters!  Show off your savvy of the campus!

 

1.      Check in at Deering Meadow starting at 5 pm.  Once youâ€™ve registered, we start at 5:30. The earlier you arrive, the better.  Teams of up to four people can participate, and one person needs a smart phone in order to download the free app SCVNGR (you can do this beforehand to save time).

2.      Locations are worth different amounts of points, depending on their difficulty to find.  You will take pictures of the stops, and that is how we will verify that you were there. 

3.      For every stop/picture that you tweet to @NUHomecoming, you will receive a bonus point.

4.      Return to Deering by 7:30, when the Homecoming Hunt ends. We will check in your answers and determine the winner.  Winners will be announced at All Cat on Wednesday night.
