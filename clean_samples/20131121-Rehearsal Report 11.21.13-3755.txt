Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a short rehearsal, but were able to get down some blocking for those who hadn’t been able to come to rehearsal this past week.
    We will be able to start working on the end of Act 2 and into the beginning of Act 3 this Saturday, and we anticipate having almost the entire cast here, which will be exciting!

Scenery Notes:

    We’ve been blocking scenes with Brutus on the platforms USR that would require a bench—we may need to make the platforms bigger, if that’s possible? (This also means we would need a bench.) Maia will talk to you.
    We also need to make sure there is an entrance DSR.
