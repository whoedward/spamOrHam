Daniel thought it'd be a good idea to list things we should remember to bring or do before tomorrow morning. Here's his list in almost alphabetical order:

-change of clothes
-clip your finger/toenails
-clean uniform/belt
-water bottle (or gatorade)
-snacks
-sparring gear (if you have it)
-student ID
-$20

And if you're Pius:
- camera

I realized I don't have a mouthguard -- so we can definitely pick one up?

Thanks.

Would probably also be good to send out a list of everything people will need (easy to forget simple stuff like "belt" haha. Here's a list of what I can think of

-change of clothes
-clip your finger/toenails
-clean uniform/belt
-water bottle (or gatorade)
-snacks
-sparring gear (if you have it)
-student ID
-$20

PS. are you picking the car up from SPAC or from the motor pool? If from the motor pool I'll meet you there (closer) but if from SPAC I'll just meet you at blom

    Oh, and before I forget!

    Pius, don't forget your camera. If anyone else has a video camera, you should bring it as well.

    Also, if you still need a mouthpiece, there are sporting goods stores near Purdue where we can pick one up. (Stores in Evanston aren't open at 6 AM, unfortunately)

        Hey everyone,

        The purdue tournament is this Saturday, so there will be no Saturday practice.

        For those of you who are going to compete, we are meeting in the Blomquist parking lot at 6 AM. Set your alarms accordingly and try not to party too hard tonight. Also, bring $20. Because that's how much registration costs for sparring, forms, and/or both. ;)

        By the way, in case anyone is wondering who is going to compete:

        Ji-hoon Kim
        Daniel Sauza
        Allan Dong
        Pius Kim
        Albert Hong

        Everyone's doing sparring, and I'm doing both sparring and forms. Not sure who else is doing forms. Wish us all luck and see you all at practice Monday except the people listed above whom I'll see in the cold, dark parking lot at Blom.

        Ji-hoon
