Hey AIChE!

It's time to elect the new American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Executive Board, and we need YOU to run!

AIChE executive board works together to promote career development, to facilitate relationships between undergraduates and faculty within the department, and to boost the sense of community among chemical engineers!  Executive board is a low time commitment, and a great opportunity to build up leadership experience. The positions include:

President
Vice-President
Secretary
Treasurer
Social Chair
Technology Chair
Alumni Relations
Class Representative

Please fill out this form if you are interested by midnight next Wednesday (April 10)!
