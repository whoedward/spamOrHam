Professor,

Thank you for your swift response. I have added a cc of this to my fellow team members, who I imagine would also like to think you for your celerity.

Stay dry,
Team Four

    Hi Team Four,
    As you may recall, I made a mistake about the team numbers, so I had prepared for the wrong team on Feb. 5.Therefore, all the team conferences are delayed by one class period.  You were to be Tuesday, Feb. 12, but now that meeting, as I mentioned in class, is moved to Thursday, February, one class period later.

    Regards,

    Professor Herrick

        Hello Professor Herrick,

        Team Four (section one) here. We are emailing you in regards to the essay meeting time and date. According to the syllabus, our essay conference is this upcoming Tuesday (2/12/13). However, according to the syllabus the following Thursday (2/14/13) is a day on which Team Four should prepare for our essay conference. We will be preparing for our conference this Tuesday regardless, but would like some clarity on the issue. Thank you for your time.

        Best,
        Team Four
