I am on that shift. If we're coming in at 7:30 and we're both there on time, it should be okay. If this is an event loaded with high-rollers, though, we should get another tech onboard.

    I would think two people can set that in an hour's time, but we can certainly try to get someone else on that if you want. Ethan, isn't that your shift? What do you think?
