Hello 252 students,

To help you prepare for the first exam, I will be holding a study session tomorrow from 3-5pm in the ESAM small conference room, M453, where office hours are usually held. I realize this may not be the most convenient time for many of you, so please feel free to contact me via email if you have questions about the exam material.

Best,
Haley
