Hello Michael,

I am covering another KASA event in Ryan today, and they had a question about the staircase that leads backstage. As of right now, the light in the stairway is not working. I am not sure if this is a tech issue (i.e., the light is broken), or a human issue (i.e., I cannot find the switch). Regardless, could you help me out with this, please?

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
