Hi Norris!

Don't forget that the first Norris Town Hall of the year is coming up on Tuesday, November 4 at 4:30pm in the Lake Room (Rm 203)!

The Town Hall offers a great chance for you to learn about upcoming events and learning opportunities in Norris and around the University! It is also a place to share any updates your department might have and/or any general questions, comments, and concerns you may have about working at Norris. Plus it's the perfect time to get to know your fellow amazing staff members from various departments!


So come join the conversation! We're looking forward to seeing you there!
