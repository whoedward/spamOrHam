Hello everyone,

Great job for a successful first lab day start. Keep up the good work. In spite of today's success, I wanted to reiterate the proper lab attire policy that you should all be aware of. Northwestern University is striving to create a safe learning environment for your laboratory related courses. As such, it is required that all personnel working in the lab (you and me in this case) are required to wear fire retardant lab coats. Failure to meet this requirement will result in dismissal from the lab with a minimal points opportunity (just the 20-point prelab). I believe this is posted in blackboard and you all received an email from Dr. Priest about this. For this lab course, this policy will be strictly reinforced. So I would highly suggest you buy those labcoats. Thanks everyone and have a good evening.

Sincerely,
Cornelius
