Hey Evan,

SO sorry that we sent you an email disciplining you. You're totally off the hook and we'll have some make up for you at some point soon.

Just for future reference, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with stuff like this. We'll all get it and then someone will see you. I was a goober and didn't check my email.

Please feel better.

Best,

All of us, but especially me.

    Hey Ethan,

    I have a pretty serious migraine and have been vomiting as well. Unfortunately that means I won't be able to make the training I had signed up for. Could you also forward this to the supervisors who are leading training today?

    Thanks 

    Evan
