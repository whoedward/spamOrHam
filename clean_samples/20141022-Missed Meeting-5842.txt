To NTS Supervisot,

Sorry, I had a Vietnamese Student Association meeting today and forgot to email you guys that I was going to miss the meeting tonight.  I'm very sorry and it won't happen again.  I'll be sure to email you earlier next time.

P.S. I like my shift schedule where it is right now, and prefer it not be changed.
