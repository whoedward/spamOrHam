The syllabus indicates nothing for this week.

Our GANTT chart indicates that we should begin brainstorming, building mock-ups, generating alternatives, and doing performance and user testing. Not all of these are possible right now, but we should discuss, how we will approach them.

Finally we need to discuss, in person, the logistics of our trip to RIC.

Should be a short meeting. I'll see you there.

Jonas
