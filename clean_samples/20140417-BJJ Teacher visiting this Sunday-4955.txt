Hi everyone!

A purple belt BJJ competitor and teacher contacted me about teaching for our club.
We agreed that he would come do a trial lesson, and then the club would decide if we want to work something out to have him teach in the future.

So, please come to practice this Sunday if you can to help make that decision. Also, it will hopefully be a good class! I'll send out another reminder Saturday night.
