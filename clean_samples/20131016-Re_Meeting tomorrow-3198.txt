Hi Ryan,

Though we're not penalizing you, please be aware that extracurricular or other recreational/non-academic activities do not constitute a valid excuse for missed meetings. Valid excuses for absences are class-related conflicts, health matters, or another outstanding conflict discussed with and approved by the supers. 

Thanks,
Bobby Ramirez

    Hello,

    Afraid I can't make the meeting tomorrow; I'm attending a 7-8pm yoga class.  In the future I'll try to make sure the class doesn't overlap with the meeting, but this is the only one I could go to this week.

    Sorry again,
    Ryan
