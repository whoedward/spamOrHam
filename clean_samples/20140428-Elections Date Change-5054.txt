Hey guys,

Apparently, this year all upcoming student organizations officers are required to attend a symposium on May 17th. Due to this, we will unfortunately have to pull up our election date. I apologize for the inconvenience, but the elections will now take place on Monday of May 5th.

Now, for the election process itself.

The process is very simple. We will nominate people for each leadership position, and everyone will write one or two names down on a ballot for people they think are best qualified for the position. This will take place at the beginning of practice (8:00 P.M.)  on May 5th.

The positions available are as follows:

-Two co-presidents
-One treasurer
-Historians*
-One social event planner*

The positions marked by an asterisk are new and something we will try out.

Here are the list of duties for each position:

Co-presidents (2) (the two officers will split the following responsibilities as they see fit):
-Overall management of the club and how it should be run
-Filling out the paperwork (quarterly report, annual budget sheet, really not much I promise)
-Attendance at the quarterly sports club presidents' meeting
-BTMA relationship management
-Warm-ups and how they should be run
-Communication via listserv and emails
-Recruitment
-Organizing tournaments
-KASA Show and other demo preparations
-May also have to organize the annual belt test tournament for BTMA during Fall Quarter

Treasurer (1):
-Management over all monetary actions (paying instructors, managing SOFO, buying equipments, deciding on quarterly dues)
-Attendance at the quarterly sports club treasurers' meeting

Historian (as many as we'd like):
-Occasionally taking pictures and videos during practices and other club events
-Helping out with flyers and other media

Social Event Planner (one for now):
-Planning fun social events (at least one per quarter) for the club! (Sorry, no alcohol per university rules. Y'all can do that at your own leisure)

Whew, now that that's out of the way, just a couple of remarks. First off, belt rank DOES NOT MATTER. Don't think that just because you haven't reached black belt rank or any other rank that you aren't qualified to be the president. Second, don't be intimidated by any of the responsibilities of any of these positions, especially for the presidents' position. It may seem like a lot, but that is why we will have two presidents, so that you will be able to support each other. Also, all of the officers from this year will still be returning next year to the club. We will prepare you for next year and will act as your advisors and mentors throughout the year.

I understand that everyone is pretty busy these days, but please try to come on time to practice on May 5th 8:00 P.M. at least for the election. The more of you that come, the more fair representation of this club that we can get.

I will see you guys all then. Thanks!

Yours,
Davin
