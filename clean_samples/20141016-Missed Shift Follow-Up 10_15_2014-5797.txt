Hey Juan,

This is a follow-up email for the conversation that we had earlier concerning your missed meeting last night (10/15/2014). Please note again that this is a warning.

Remember to be present and on time for the meetings, and to send valid excuses for any that you cannot make.

If you have any questions, please email me or the supervisors at ntssupervisors@gmail.com.

Regards,
