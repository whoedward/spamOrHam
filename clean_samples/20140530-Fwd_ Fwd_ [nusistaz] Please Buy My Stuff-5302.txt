Hi guys, 

I'm trying to get rid of all my stuff so I'm selling--

    dark brown desk with two drawers for $35
    fridge for $35
    Two large, plastic 3-drawer storage units with wooden tops for $10 each 
    desk lamp for free
    door mirror for $15 (still in its box because I bought it before I saw the apartment to find out that my closet's door had a mirror on it)

You're welcome to come see anything if you're interested.
