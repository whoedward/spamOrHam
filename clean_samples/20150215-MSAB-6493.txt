Hey Ethan, my name is Brennan and I am one of the co-chairs for MSAB. We’ve noticed that you’ve been relatively nonexistent in terms of activity within the group, and this is just a final check-in. Starting Feb. 20th, we’re going to be removing people from the group who haven’t communicated with us. If our meeting time doesn’t work for you or something feel free to let us know and we can give you projects outside the meeting. Otherwise, the people who have not been involved or even talked to either me or Jane will be removed from the group and the LISTSERV. Let me know if you have any questions!
