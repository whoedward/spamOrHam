Hey everyone,

Assassins will be starting soon, but before I can begin the game, I need to test out all of the water pistols I got the other day. If you would like to help me test them out, I'll be in the main lounge at 7pm tomorrow Sunday.

Also, I will be handing out water pistols after open exec. There are 4 different types of water pistols, so it's a first-come first-serve for water pistols tomorrow.

Thanks!
Thomas
