Hello,

I am not certain if this is the correct email to contact for my issue, and I apologize if it is not.
However, I am unable to "confirm" my emergency information in either Chrome or Firefox. This would be a lot less frustrating if it did not imply an eventual hold on registrations. Is there any advice that you could offer me?

Best,
Ethan Robison
