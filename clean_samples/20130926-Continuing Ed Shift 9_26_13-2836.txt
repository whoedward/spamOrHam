Hey Nelson,

I just wanted to double check to make sure that you were aware that you are signed up for the 10 a.m. - 12 p.m. Continuing Ed shift on Thursdays. If there is a misunderstanding, please let us know immediately.

Otherwise, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com promptly with a reason as to why you missed this shift. I know that you were out of town last night, but please remember that you are responsible for a shift being covered no matter what.

Regards,
Ethan Robison
