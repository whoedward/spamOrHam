Hi all,

Due to some issue about the reservation system, the E133 room is not available today. If you have questions please come directly to my office, which is Catalysis 221. You can easily get here through the bridge on the second floor of Tech in K-wing. I will be available from now to 5:00 pm. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Tomorrow's office hour will be at E225 from 2:30pm to 3:30pm.

Hongda
