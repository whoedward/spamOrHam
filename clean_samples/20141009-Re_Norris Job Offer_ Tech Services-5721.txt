Hi Chen,

Michael's hours are typically 8:00 a.m. until around 3:30 p.m., and he is there Monday through Friday. Additionally, some of the forms need to go to Jenn Stripe on the third floor. Her hours are similar.

Best,
Ethan

    Hey Ethan,

    I have my forms ready so I called Michael McKean to see if he was in the office and it seems that he's out of the office. I will send an email and follow up on that tomorrow. Thought I should give you a heads up.

    Best,
    Chen
