        Hey everyone,

        I made the t-shirt design on computer...
        Picture 1 is using yellow.
        Picture 2 is using red.
        Both shirts are black and most prints are white. 

        Bobby and I prefer yellow but feel free to voice your opinion :) :) :)

        Thanks~

        Phoebe
