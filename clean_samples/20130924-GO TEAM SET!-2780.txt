Heyyo set designers!
and hey Ethan, can't wait to meet you man, I'm psyched to have you on board.

Hope you guys had a good first day of classes.
I know it's a crazy week, figuring things out, but I was hoping we could find some time to meet up and chat about what the SoulCon set is gonna look like.

I'm done with class at noon tomorrow (wednesday), free from 2-4 on thurs, and don't have any class on Fri so if we could find even a half hour to talk about things before rehearsals start next monday, that'd be really awesome.

We'll just toss some ideas around and see if we get anywhere near starting a ground plan so let me know asap what your weeks look like.

This ball is totally rolling. Get pumped.
