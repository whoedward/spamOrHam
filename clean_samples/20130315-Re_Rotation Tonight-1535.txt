Hey!

I have an event that ends around 9 so I could definitely cover you from 9-close if no one else can.

    Hi NTS,

    Is anybody willing to pick up my rotation tonight? I have an essay due tomorrow that is just not coming together right now, and I want to focus completely on it for the rest of the day.

    Thanks,

    Alex
