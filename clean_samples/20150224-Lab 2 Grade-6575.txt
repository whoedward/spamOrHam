Hi Professor,

I am a student in your 11 a.m. databases course.
As of yet, I have not received a grade for lab 2. I just wanted to check to make sure that it was submitted and received, and that you don't need anything additional from me. Please let me know if you do and I will fix it immediately!

Best,
