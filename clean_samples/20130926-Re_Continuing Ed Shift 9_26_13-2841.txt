It was accidentally signed up for me. I think Jolo had this same problem where he was signed up for this shift, I thought this happened to everyone so I didn't think I needed to notify you guys about it. Regardless, I did not sign up for this shift, and it was just placed on me. Sorry for not notifying the supervisors about this problem earlier.

Best,
Nelson

    Hey Nelson,

    I just wanted to double check to make sure that you were aware that you are signed up for the 10 a.m. - 12 p.m. Continuing Ed shift on Thursdays. If there is a misunderstanding, please let us know immediately.

    Otherwise, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com promptly with a reason as to why you missed this shift. I know that you were out of town last night, but please remember that you are responsible for a shift being covered no matter what.

    Regards,
    Ethan Robison
