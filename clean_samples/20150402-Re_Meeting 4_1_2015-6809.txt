Hey Ethan! I accidentally sent my reason as a response to the email William sent about the meeting instead of sending it to the ntssupervisors address. I attached a screenshot of it. (I was at a tech rehearsal).

Thanks,

Nathan

    We noticed that you weren't at the meeting tonight, but we didn't get anything from you about where you were. Just wanted to check in. Email me or ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your response.

    Regards,
