ISRC,

At some point in the near future, your suite will be hosting Munchies. This will involve you purchasing food from a restaurant with your theme and being reimbursed for it. To make this simpler on Victor and you, you must do two things:

Choose a restaurant that you will order your food from.
--Remember that 150$ doesn't go as far as you might think, so be economical.

Tell Victor and me this restaurant, in order to get a tax exempt form.
-- You won't be reimbursed for tax otherwise, so do it!

Thanks,
Jonas
