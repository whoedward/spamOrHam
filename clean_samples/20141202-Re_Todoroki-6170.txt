    Yo,
    I have class, so I will be there by 12:30 at the latest, probablcloser to noon (it depends on my prof, but I should be able to duck out).

        Hello all,
        You are receiving this e-mail because you signed up for Todoroki. This is a reminder that we are leaving ISRC at 11:45 AM, which is in less than 9 hours. We will leave promptly as our reservation is at noon, so please plan accordingly. If you have notified me that you will be meeting us at the restaurant, I have accounted for that.

        Thank you very much. See y'all tomorrow.
        Paul Kim
