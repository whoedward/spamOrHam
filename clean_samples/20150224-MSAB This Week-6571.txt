Hey MSAB!

At our meeting this past week, we focused on getting our projects back on track, taking some preliminary steps to get E-Week started, and launching the Gotaas award. This coming week, we'll be meeting at our usual time (6pm on Thursday) in the Dean's Conference Room. 

If you're the lead of a project--make sure your project has a form in the project forms folder on the Google drive, and try to make sure that the project form is up-to-date and has as much information on your project as you have. 

Additionally, we'll be talking about t-shirts for E-Week this Thursday, so if everyone could try to come up with a few ideas and bring them to the meeting---that would be great!

Thanks!
