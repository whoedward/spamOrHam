Hi Supervisors,

I'm really sorry for the late email, but the reason I wasn't able to go to the meeting is because I had lab from 6-8 PM. I tried to go switch my lab section, but the only available spot at the time was in conflict with my other EECS lab. So I don't think I'll be able to go to future meetings. I'm sorry again. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Best,

-Magan
