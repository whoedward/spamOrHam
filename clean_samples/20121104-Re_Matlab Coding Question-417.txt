Professor,

I did manage to write a working program (it's currently submitted), but I'm still not entirely sure why that particular part works. I can always ask you in person, as I understand that email does a poor job of conveying a message.

    Hi Ethan,

    %Here, if I replace M(:,:) with M(jj,:) and attempt to run the code,
       %Matlab outputs the error message "subscripted assignment dimension
       %mismatch." If I use M(:,:), however, things run perfectly fine.
       %Can you offer any sort of explanation as to why this is?
       %The confusion that arises, for me, is that it would seem that using
       %M(:,:) would replace all of the rows and columns with row jj, whatever
       %that happens to be at a given time.

    M(:,:) is the same as M, that is the whole matrix of size m x n.
    M(jj,:) is the row jj of M, which is of size 1 x n

    I believe divide(M, jj, M(jj,jj)) returns a matrix of size(M) right?

    Does it  answer your question?

        Dear Professor,

        Attached is a .m file that I am currently using for the homework problem. At line 30, I have inserted a comment about the difficulties that I was having. Could you please look over the code and answer the question that I inserted there?

        However, if my issue is confusing (I realize that it is difficult to convey a question through Matlab comments), I am available to meet with you in person, instead.

        Thanks,
        Ethan Robison
