Hey y'all!

So last week at the bottom of the ASG weekly I offered chocolate to anyone who replied to my email. Nobody emailed me so I assume that out of all 300ish of you not a single person even skimmed to the bottom of this email. Please at least skim read these emails, they actually have some cool stuff in them. 

Happy Olympics, go team USA! (and also team NZ)

Student Group Apportionment Committee Applications due Feb. 19th

This application serves as the first step for your student group(s) to obtain a presence in Senate. Each application will be reviewed, interviews will take place and final decisions will be made prior to the first senate of the year.

In order to maximize representation in Senate, the Student Group Apportionment Committee highly encourages groups to apply for a seat together.  For your reference, groups with seats during the 2013-14 school year are listed on the last page.  From there, selected groups will decide independently how best to select a specific individual to represent those groups in Senate.

The deadline to submit applications is February 19th at 6:59pm.

Please submit your application and direct any questions to ASG Chief of Staff at asg-cos@u.northwestern.edu.  Interview times will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Applicantions can be found here.
