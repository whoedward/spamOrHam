Hello!

I am done with the new employee paperwork but have a question regarding the IL-W-4. Since this is a work-study job, am I exempt from federal and Illinois Income Tax withholding? In addition, how do I use self-service to sign up for a direct deposit of my payroll?
I will be at the meeting tomorrow night if it is easier to go over these questions then.

See you tomorrow,
Didi Aburaad
