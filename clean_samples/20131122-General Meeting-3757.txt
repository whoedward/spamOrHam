Hey, guys,

I just wanted to let you know that we will have our meeting tomorrow morning at Le Peep. I'd like to have the meeting START at 10:45 A.M., so let's try to get there a little earlier. I'll try to get there earlier to reserve seats. And do still let me know if you're coming or not.

-Davin
