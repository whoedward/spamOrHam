All,

Since you haven't yet gotten your first homework problem set, I'm not going to hold office hours tonight unless some number (let's say two or three of you) respond back asking otherwise. I've got something else tomorrow as well, so for now I'm cancelling those hours. If you have any questions, shoot me an email and I'll work with you to find a time to meet up.

Best,

Kevin
