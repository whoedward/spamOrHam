Hey Michael,

I think today was a coincidental catastrophe - the two techs that didn't show up don't have a history of missing shifts and do good work while on shift, so I think it was just a bad day, not a sign of anything bigger.  As for Ethan's shift, I think we tried to get it covered at the meeting, but nobody was able to pick it up. We're sorry about what happened this morning, but I think its just an isolated incident and won't happen again.

Alex

    None of the three technicians listed in shift planning showed up this morning.  Max finally arrived at 9:15am.  There was no word from Sandy.  Ethan claimed he had released his shift for cont. Ed.  I am giving the Supers 24 hours to give me some answers why we had such a massive failure this morning and to take action.  Please make sure Sandy has a warning email sent out and is talked to.  Max also needs a warning email, Justin already spoke to him.  Ethan you need to make sure whoever has your shift for cont. ed on Thursdays is aware they need to arrive at 8:30 am, and the switch is reflected on shift planning.

    I was off campus at a  symposium this morning, so Dan had to step in.  This embarrasses me. 1 out of 3 is a mistake, 2 out of 3 is a problem, 3 out of 3 is a complete failure.  Let’s not repeat this anytime soon.
