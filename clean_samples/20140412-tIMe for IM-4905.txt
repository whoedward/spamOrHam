Hey guys
It is time for IM!!
OK so the previous schedule I had sent out was a little bit incorrect- I was looking at a different schedule I think.

Times are as follows:
Softball Sundays at 3, Long Field
Soccer Tuesdays at 7/8pm, lakeside field hockey field
Ultimate: Tuesdays at 5, Long Field

NO metal cleats for soccer are permitted. OR for softball. OR ultimate. NO. METAL. CLEATS. They don't say anything about non-metal cleats though. I dunno.

I was caught off guard. Sorry about this guys, but our first game starts TOMORROW. Softball, Sunday at 3. Long Field. Meet in the lobby at 2:30, it takes a while to get to Long Field and we'll have some time to warm up.
I may or may not have work tomorrow. I'm trying to get my shift covered. In case that I can't make it, Dylan will be your IM captain. Otherwise I should be able to make the softball games. Shout out to Dylan, who has also worked on getting us IM jerseys/t-shirts.

Ultimate starts this Tuesday. 5 pm. I'll send out an e-mail on Monday.
Soccer starts this Tuesday. 8pm. I'll send out an e-mail on Monday.

If you want to look at the schedules, check them out below

Ultimate: http://nuim.northwestern.edu/team.php?team=4724
Soccer: http://nuim.northwestern.edu/rules.php?sport=Soccer

Gender rules for Softball: Must alternate batters. Need to have equal number of men and women, so PLEASE we need a lot of attendance from both our men and our women. Again, hopefully I can make it; if not, I apologize. We are paired with Shepard for Softball.
We pitch to our own team. You get 3 pitches to hit.  Other than that, not too much different. I'll let you know about the other sports' rules on Monday.

Great. Thanks so much guys. Lobby at 2:30 tomorrow for softball. If I can't make it, Dylan's in charge.
