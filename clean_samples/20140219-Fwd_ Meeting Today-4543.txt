Hey supervisors,

I'm in Baja mode right now since our race is Saturday and the car isn't done yet.  I won't be able to make the meeting.  I'll also need my 10am-2pm on Friday covered since we're leaving Friday morning.  If at all possible it would be nice for my Continuing Ed shift 12:30-3:30pm tomorrow covered too, but I realize this may be too much to ask.  I will also need that shift (Thurs the 27th 12:30-3:30) covered next week for an interview, not sure if you need to bring it up this soon though.  I've released them all on ShiftPlanning.

Thanks,

Will
