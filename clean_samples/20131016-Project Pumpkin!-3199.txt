Hello, lovely ISRCers!

Project Pumpkin is next Thursday, October 24, from 4-6:30pm!!! It's so much fun - basically, little kids from Evanston come to Norris to trick-or-treat, and ISRC gets to host a booth! Each shift is only a half hour long, and it would be great to have at least two people per shift. SIGN UP WITH FRIENDS! It's a great way to get a philanthropy point, hang out with people, and get ready to celebrate Halloween. (Dressing up is optional but encouraged!) And Norris is so close! PLEASE SIGN UP ON MY DOODLE POLL!!!!  http://doodle.com/b74chcye7dvrk68h Thanks, guys. :) I love you all! 

ISRClove,
Ayla

P.S. SIGN UP FOR THE ZOMBIE WALK ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25. I know I said sign up by today, but I'm extending it until Friday. :) EMAIL ME!

P.P.S. DONATE FOOD TO THE FOOD DRIVE!!!! Rust/Mocha is winning so far. REPRESENT YOUR SUITE COLOR!!!

Thanks again! <3
