Hello again.

Turns out that keyboard shortcuts suck, and sends messages before they are done! This is troublesome. Anywho...

We are missing 3 PS3 games from the basement, and have been for almost a quarter now. They are: Drakes Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, and Fifa 2013. 

We are also missing an Xbox 360 disc for Skyrim.

We are ALSO missing an Xbox 360 controller, black, with a sticker of a power button sign on the front.

I need these items to be returned to the basement or my room, ISRC #201, no questions asked, by Friday morning. Unfortunately after this time, Amanda (area coordinator) is going to have to get involved. 

I know we are all forgetful at times, so if you still have them after borrowing them, just please return them. 

Thanks a lot guys, and sorry for the mis-message,
Eric Morales
