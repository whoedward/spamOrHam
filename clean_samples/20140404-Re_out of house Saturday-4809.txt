Hi Michael,

We were confused about this event at the meeting because on the AV board it just said "AV pickup" so we assumed we didn't need to schedule anyone for the event. Could you let us know what times we need to schedule people for delivery, set up, and tear down? Do we need to schedule someone for the entire event? Thanks for your help, and sorry for the confusion.
