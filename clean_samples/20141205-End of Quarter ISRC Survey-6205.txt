Hello ISRCers!

Here is your opportunity for an extra point in any category and having a better experience next quarter in ISRC! Fill out this survey that will help the Exec Board plan more events centered around what YOU want next quarter! You can submit anonymously, but if you want an extra point, you'll need to put your name on the form so I know who to give the point to. 

Link to the form: http://goo.gl/forms/do7Eri212T

Good luck on your finals and happy holidays! :D
