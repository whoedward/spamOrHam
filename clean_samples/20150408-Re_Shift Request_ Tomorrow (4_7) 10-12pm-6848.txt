Sorry, class! If nobody can take it here, we can try to get it covered during the meeting.

    Hello everybody!

    I changed my schedule around and now have class from 11-12:20pm on Tuesdays. If someone could take the 10-12 part of my continued ed shift, that would be greatly appreciated!

    Thanks,
    Didi
