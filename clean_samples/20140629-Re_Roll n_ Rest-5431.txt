Elizabeth and team,

I think I forwarded some folders that appear to contain useful information. Let us know if there is more we can help you with or send to you. I hope you guys can figure something out. It was project that we thought had a lot of potential, but couldn't get everything together in the end. Let us know what you end up doing. I'm sure we'll all be excited to see how Brian is doing.

Have a nice summer,
Jonas

    Hey Elizabeth,

    I looked through our old emails. I'll forward some of what we have. Do you have our old report?

    Hope I can help,

        Dear Team Three,

        I am an intern working with the Segal Design Institute this summer. My fellow interns are copied on this email. We are looking into your Roll n' Rest project. It would be a great help if you could share with us any documentation or videos you may have.

        Thank you for your help,
        Elizabeth McTighe
