Hello Professors,

The members of Team Four are contacting you in regards to the syllabus. We would like to know if it would be possible for the document to be transferred to a Googledoc. As you are aware, the syllabus is a living document and is updated constantly, and one must download a new version every time that it changes. This is an issue that appears whenever a team member has failed to notice a new version, and is left with an outdated copy.

Thanks for your consideration,
Team Four
