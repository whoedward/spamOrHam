Hey guys!

So I know the weather hasn't been the best (aka the worst) but Spring quarter has a ton of programs and I want to go to this one with you!

It's a FREE magic show in Norris on WEDNESDAY at 7pm. 

COME WITH ME.
Meet in the lobby at 6:40pm

There's a description belooowwww...

 Magician Jim Munroe experienced a devastating diagnosis of Leukemia that predicted only a few months for him to live, The MAZE features Munroeâ€™s incredible magic performance as he shares his life story.
