Hey guys,

Next Thursday a candidate for the new Director of Dining is coming in to have lunch with students and we're rounding up some people to go. The lunch will be from about 12:15-1:30 pm in the Chicago Room. We need about 10 people for this so please let me know if you will be able to attend.

Thanks!
