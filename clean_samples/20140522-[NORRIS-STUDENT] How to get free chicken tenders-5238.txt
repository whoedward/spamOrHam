Snatch up a cutie of your own before tomorrow, or ride solo like ya do.  Also, fill out this song request form if you have any jams in mind for the dance off we're having at 9:30, and make sure you include the artist.

There will also be a limbo contest at 10:15, and a best dressed for the Beach Party theme (  ) contest earlier in the night.  Prizes are still in the works (did someone say meal tickets?!) but at the very least you will win eternal glory.
