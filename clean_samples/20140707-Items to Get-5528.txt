Hey bud. I'm guessing only you can edit the evernote? Here's some things I possess:

(my dad's handwriting is dif√≠cil so bear with me)

Small vacuum
Swiffer Sweeper Starter Pack
Fresh Brush Toilet Kit w/Brush & Caddy
Sponges (3)
Bathroom shelving
Scrub brush (not sure what distinguishes that from the brush above, I'll ask when he's awake)
Hot pads (2)
Oven mitts (2)
Coffee table
Floor lamp
