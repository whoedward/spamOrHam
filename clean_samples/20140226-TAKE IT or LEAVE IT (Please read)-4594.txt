HEY EVERYONE READ THIS, IT'S COOL (AND IN CAPS SO YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT) 

The eco-reps are putting on an event this Friday at Norris from 12-4 called take it or leave it, where you will go and take the clothes that other NU students don't want. The "leave it" part comes from this: a box will be in the lobby all day tomorrow and Friday morning for you to GET RID OF ALL THE CLOTHES YOU NO LONGER WANT, HASSLE-FREE! Just toss 'em in. Any clothes that people don't take at Norris will be donated. 

 Go Cats, 
Bob "Eco-Chair" Sherman
