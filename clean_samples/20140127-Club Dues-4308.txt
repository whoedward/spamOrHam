Friends! Dues are due by this Saturday's practice. Dues are $40 for the quarter.
Reminder, if you need a payment plan (aka, you cannot provide $40 by Saturday) PLEASE EMAIL ME. If you do not email me, and do not pay dues by this Saturday, you will not be allowed to continue practice.

To any new people who have only just started coming to practice, please email me, and we can push back your deadline to February 15th.

Joanna
