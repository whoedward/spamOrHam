You're right, that graph is incorrect. But, you're very close. The only remaining problem is  a small matrix algebra error.
At some point in your derivation you must have an equation of the form

    M*D = f                          (before you had M = ( [-w^2*I] -w*[c1K + c2I]*tan(w*t) + K), which, as we saw, is not quite right)

after which you wrote down

    D= f*M^-1

But order matters in matrix multiplication. To solve for D, you have to multiply both side of the first equation by M^-1 on the left. That gives

    D = M^-1 * f


I'm pretty sure that making that small change will give you the correct result.

Remember that for a cosine you either guess a particular solution that includes sin and cos, matching up terms after you substitute, or you replace cos(w t) with e^(i w t ), use e^(i w t) in the particular solution and take real part of the solution at the end.
