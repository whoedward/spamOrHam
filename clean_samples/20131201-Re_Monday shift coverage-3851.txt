        > Hey everyone, yesterday I sent out an email but accidentally sent it to the summer NTS listserv.  I'm not going to be back in town yet tomorrow and so can't make my 8am-10am monday shift.  It's an early one but usually there's literally no events at that time so it's a very low-stress shift.  I'll be back in town later this week since I'm helping my family with things here, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help with this.  Thanks!
