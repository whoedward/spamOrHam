Hi All,

Welcome back to the start of spring quarter! I will be hosting weekly office hours and will be kicking off today with Whiney Wednesdays. Feel free to drop by and see me from 12 - 2p in my office (first floor of ISRC). Come eat meats, cheeses, and drink (non-alcoholic) wine while whining about your week with me! BYOG (bring your own glassware).

The two weekly events for spring quarter will be:

    Whiney Wednesdays 12 - 2p in my office: come eat meats, cheeses, and drink (non-alcoholic) wine while whining about your week with me! BYOG (bring your own glassware).
    Thank Goodness It's Friday (T.G.I.F.s) 3-5p on Friday in my office: come eat cookies, drink tea/coffee with me! BYOM (bring your own mug).
        Note: these won't start until May 8th.

These times will be also posted on my office door.  

Also, I will be sending out an e-mail today about Cross RC events - we've got an amazing line-up, so look out for that later!

Best,

Jen
Assistant Master, ISRC
