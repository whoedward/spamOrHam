    Hey So I have the Saturday shifts from 12-2 and 2-4 and was wondering if anyone on Saturday morning or Friday after 1 or thursday after 5 would be willing to permanently change shifts with me. its super important and I would love you forever. Also Saturday shifts at my times usually have not much to do. I really really really need to find someone to change with.
