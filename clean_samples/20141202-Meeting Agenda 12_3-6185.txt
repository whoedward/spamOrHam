Here is the meeting agenda for tomorrow.  AV Board is light, just a couple deliveries.  I will not be at the meeting because of my sorority formal.  My shifts are released on Shiftplanning & on the agenda.

Remember to get all your shifts released before tomorrow in the interest of time.  And feel free to start grabbing shifts you want.

I'll miss you guys over break; hope you have a great December!
