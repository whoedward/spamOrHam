Michael,

First, I would like to apologize for the failure on my part to ensure that this action was carried through. Second, I would like to offer my word that every effort will be made in the future to ensure that things will go smoothly.

Sincerely,
Ethan

> There were very specific instructions for the SALT meeting in the Wildcat room written on the sheets and highlighted.  The notes referred to meeting the clients at 8:45 and coming back at 9:30 to set up their second presentation.  As you know I helped with the 8:45 set up, however the 9:30 set up was never done.  I know this because Kelly was in the room and told me the presenter had trouble connecting her laptop to the projector at 9:30.  As a supervisor I expect, that you expect your employees to follow through.  The ball was dropped at an extremely important meeting.  Please make sure that your staff knows to read all the details on sheets and follow through.
