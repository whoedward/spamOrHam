Hey, guys,

I hope you guys all had an awesome Thanksgiving :) I sure did with a lot of good food and time with my family~

As the quarter winds down, I'd like to hold one last general meeting to discuss plans for next quarter and to come up with a code of conduct. As usual, everyone is more than welcome to attend. For this particular meeting, I would like to really encourage all the black belts and other senior-ranking members to attend this meeting as each and every one of you hold a valuable perspective that others may not have. With that in mind, I have set up a Doodle sheet on which you all can fill out your availability. The final time and location of this meeting will be announced sometime on Monday (although, it would be great if we can hold this meeting during our usual practice time on Saturday 12/07). Again, let me emphasize that we'd like to have everyone come, especially the black belt members and other senior-ranking members.

Here's the Doodle link: http://doodle.com/ddtisyupvzusreh2

Let me know if there are any questions or concerns. Also, we're still taking volunteers for the tournament test. Let me know if you're free and willing to help out. More details on that to come soon.

Yours,
Davin
