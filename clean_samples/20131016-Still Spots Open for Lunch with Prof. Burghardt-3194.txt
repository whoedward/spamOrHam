Hey everyone,

There are still about five spots open for the Brown Bag Lunch with Professor Burghardt on Monday, October 21st, from 12PM - 1 PM in Room A110.  If you want to come, email me with your sandwich preference by tomorrow (Thursday) night.

For those of you who already emailed me: 

I got all of your sandwich orders and plan on everyone receiving what they wanted.

If you can please come a few minutes before noon, or as soon as you can, because we have the room for exactly one hour and I'd like to make the most out of it.

Thanks guys,

Alex
