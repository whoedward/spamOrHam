Hey ISRC,

Here's a cool event that's coming up. Check it out! 
----------------------------------

Greetings, friends

National Poetry Month is drawing to a close, and to wrap it all up we have a super awesome event for you - Recent Rhymes and (Un)Perfected Poetry, an open mic this Wednesday, April 30, in Dittmar Gallery (in Norris), from 7-9 pm, featuring two special guest performers. 

This open mic is completely free and open to the public, but it does have one guideline: All pieces performed must have been written sometime this past April!

Come to perform or to listen! Tell your friends! Join the Facebook event! https://www.facebook.com/events/225933417596394/

If you know you're interested in performing, please respond to this email so we can guarantee you a spot.

Hope to see you there!

Word.
