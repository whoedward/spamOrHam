    So that bye that we had last week for basketball...
    Turns out there was a clerical mistake, our bye was supposed to be this sunday, the 16th, but on our schedule it was marked for last sunday. They gave us a forfeit but I emailed the dude in charge and got it marked off. No rescheduling, unfortunately, but there's that. I'm sorry about that guys. Our next game is next sunday, the 23rd, against chapin/shepard

    But hockey is still going on!!!!!! Sunday! The 23rd! At Patten! Meet at the lobby at 5:35! Wear black! Bring your WILDCard!

    Current records:
    Basketball: 0-2
    Hockey: 1-1
    ISRC: 1000000-0
