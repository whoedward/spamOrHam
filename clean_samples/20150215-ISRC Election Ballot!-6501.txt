Hey ISRC!

The ballot for next year's Exec Board is now open. Please vote at this link: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1bG4JqeJwD7_IeMY0IUuTEFwA6DFgwbUimLuEmT8lcNM/viewform?usp=send_form

We need at least 2/3 of the dorm to vote or else this whole process needs to start all over again. Encourage others to vote after you vote! There are no uncontested positions, so you have two options on the ballot: the candidate and a no confidence option. You can also read little blurbs every candidate wrote about themselves. 

As a reminder, we still have no one running for Tech Chair and Fellows Chair so if you want to run for either of those positions, please contact me ASAP.

Thank you!
