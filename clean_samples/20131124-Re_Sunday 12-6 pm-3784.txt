    can someone please take my 4-6?

        Hey guys, 
        Because of the home football game, the club meeting I have is moved from 12-6 on Sunday, rather than Saturday. 
        Therefore, I need it covered.
        Anyone? 
        I've also released it on ShiftPlanning, but my 12-2 isn't even in ShiftPlanning for some reason.

        Thanks,
        Will Hyun
