Hello, lovely ISRCers!

For those of you who didn't know, I'm treasurer of the Undergraduate Psychology Association (UPA). Please see below for an awesome event that we have planned for Wednesday. Thanks!

ISRC-love,
Ayla

Hi everyone,

                   Hope you all had an amazing Thanksgiving break! We wanted to let you know that UPA and the Psychology Department will be having student-faculty social night on Wednesday, December 4th from 4-6 PM in Swift Hall (flyer is attached below). For those of you interested in going into psychology research, this will be a great chance to meet the heads of the various psychology labs on campus, as well as interact with other psychology majors (also a great way to take a break from studying). Food will be provided!


Hope to see you there!
