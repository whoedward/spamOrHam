Dear Professor,

Attached is a .m file that I am currently using for the homework problem. At line 30, I have inserted a comment about the difficulties that I was having. Could you please look over the code and answer the question that I inserted there?

However, if my issue is confusing (I realize that it is difficult to convey a question through Matlab comments), I am available to meet with you in person, instead.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
