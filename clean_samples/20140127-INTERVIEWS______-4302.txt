Hey, I contacted the people who applied and got their availabilities

Andrew Lu : After 3pm on Wed, after 1pm on Tues/Thurs, after 4pm on Fri
Brian Capella : Tues 4:30 - 8pm, Wed 2:45 - 4:30pm, Fri 1pm -7pm

We should probably try to get them in ASAP. Also we don't have a room for the meeting this week, so I'm probably going to come in a bit early Wed and see if there are any rooms available.
