Hey guys,

I've just released a couple shifts this week (Wednesday 4-6pm and Friday 8am-12pm).  I realize Friday morning many of you will be gone and the rest of you probably don't want to wake up that early, but I would really appreciate getting these covered.  I'd especially like the Wednesday evening shift covered, even just taking the last hour would be fine if that's all you can do.

Thanks,

Will
