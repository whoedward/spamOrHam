Hi everyone again!

I have a few things that I would like to add before you all move in.

First, join the Facebook group ISRC (International Studies Residential College) 2013-2014.

Second, friend request me on Facebook. Search Matt Du.

Next, here's a little about myself:
I am from Naperville, IL. My birthday is March 19th. I am a sophomore in Weinberg thinking of majoring in math. My hobbies include leisure swimming and tennis and watching the Chicago Bears and movies. This summer I worked in a chemistry research lab at NU and saw Kick-Ass 2.

Finally, email me and tell me a little about yourself (whatever you want). Also, if you have any requests, questions, or anything else email those too.

Can't wait to meet you all,
Matt
