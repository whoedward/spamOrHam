Hey there,

So Jennifer told me to email both of you about my hours that I was not able to swipe in for, so here they are.

In total, there are 22.5 in house and 2 out of house

In house dates worked are: 10/17 (2 hours), 10/18 (4 hours), 10/19 (2 hours), 10/25 (4 hours), 10/26 (2 hours), 11/1 (4.5 hours), 11/2 (2 hrs), 11/3 (2hrs)

Out of house dates worked are: 10/16 (2 hours)

All the best,

    Oh lovely! Then would you like to meet to talk about my missed hours/do you need any sort of evidence that I was on shift? Or I can send you my hours via email if that would be more convenient?

        All of your paperwork is in. Payroll just has to process the paperwork.

        Hey Jennifer,

        So I have now completed all of my paperwork. I am sorry for the earlier email about the hours I had thought I had turned in the paperwork but that was for another job. Is there anything else I need to do in order to be on the payroll with Norris?

            Hi Hannah,

             

            Did you turn in hiring paperwork? I donâ€™t see anything for you. You should not be working and you will not be able to swipe in without being hired.
