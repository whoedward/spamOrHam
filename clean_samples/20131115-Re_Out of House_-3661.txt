Michael,

I'm not sure what exactly is going on, but I believe that we deferred assignment on this event because we did not know the specifics. It wasn't on the A/v board (I do not think) and we didn't know much about it to begin with.

    I didn’t see anyone on Shiftplanning for the Monday-Tuesday Hardin hall out of House.  Was it that no one could work it- or has the shifts not been updated.  The client is asking and I’d like to be able to give her an answer.  ASAP.

     

    Thanks,
