Great job at practice today! I'll be holding review / extra training sessions starting this Monday. They'll be Monday (duh) at 7:30 pm in the basement of Patten gym. PATTEN. I don't know Ann does the color things, but PATTEN GYM.
If you missed Muay Thai, or part of Muay Thai, and want to make it up, come tomorrow. If you want more practice, come tomorrow. If you think I'm a fantastic teacher bask in my knowledge, come tomorrow. 7:30.
That's it. Let me or Ann know if you have any questions.

    Thanks to everyone who showed up to Muay Thai. It was lots of fun.

    Also, to the person who left their ATT phone at SPAC, email me back. I have it. I am in Kemper.
