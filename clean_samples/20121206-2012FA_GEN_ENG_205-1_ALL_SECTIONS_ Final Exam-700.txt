Hi EA1 Students,
The final exam is coming up next week on Tuesday, Dec. 11, at 9:00am. Here are the rooms you will go to:

Section 20,21: Tech Auditorium
Section 22: L211
Section 23: L361

The final exam will cover everything from the course including MATLAB and linear algebra.

There will not be a practice final posted. The best way to study is to go over your homework assignments, all of which are posted on Blackboard under Documents.

Best of luck preparing!

-Ilya Mikhelson
