Hey ISRC!


Here is another opportunity to get involved with Project Pumpkin!! You can be a chaperone by signing up with this email! If you don't want to do that, you can also work at the ISRC booth! If you aren't on the philanthropy committee and are interested in the latter, let me know! Please email me if you sign up to chaperone so I can give you a point! 

Happy Friday everyone!


ISRClove,


Ellen
