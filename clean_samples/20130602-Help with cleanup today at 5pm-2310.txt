Hey guys,

There was a miscommunication and a missed clean-up in the Great Room this Friday. The Great Room opens again today at 5pm during my shift, but there's a dance event happening at the same time that Juan and I should be here for. Could someone help us by cleaning up the Great Room? (You'd get offsite pay!)

Please respond whether or not you can do this.

Thanks,
Tim
