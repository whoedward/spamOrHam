Hi Gavin,

You applied for the Tech Services Assistant position a while back and talked to one of the other supervisors. As we get closer to the start of the year, I'm following up to see if you are still interested in the position and if you are, to see when you are available for an interview.

I look forward to your response. 

Best,
