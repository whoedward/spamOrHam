Hi everyone!

Here's an important message from Jenn Huang, from RCB exec, regarding a new mental health initiative that RCB is implementing.

ISRC-Love,

Nathan

Hey guys, 

I hope you are doing well and that the last few weeks of midterms haven't had you too stressed out. As you may know, RCB is collaborating with a number of different organizations throughout campus to address the issue of mental health in an initiative called "Free Your Mind." I am RCB's representative on this board.

This quarter, our main goal is reduce stigma around campus. In order to do this we have created a campaign called "Greater Than" in which we are asking individuals who have suffered from mental illness or mental health issues to take a picture of themselves and include a description of something they are proud of followed by "and I am greater than my ________." Some examples are "I participated in the UNITY fashion show and I am greater than my low self-esteem; I am an empathetic listener and I am greater than my depression; I go to all of my classes and I am greater than my ADD; I am on club soccer and I am greater than my schizophrenia."

If you are interested in participating, please email me back (jennhuang@u.northwestern.edu) with a picture of yourself holding up a blank piece of paper in the landscape form and the blurb you would like associated with that picture. Please keep in mind, exactly what you email me is what will be represented on the poster and these posters will be hung around school and be available for viewing on our initiative's website- no names will be associated.

Thank you so much for your support and please contact me with any questions!
