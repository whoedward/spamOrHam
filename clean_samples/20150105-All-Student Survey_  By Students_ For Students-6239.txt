You may have seen emails floating around about ASG's student survey. Now, if you haven't already, spend some time taking the All-Student Survey to help improve Northwestern and for the chance to win an iPad Mini from the Norris bookstore or gift cards from local Evanston businesses! This is your last chance to contribute to the ASG survey as the survey will close Friday, January 9th, at midnight.

So please fill out the survey here: bit.ly/NUsurvey14

A collaboration between ASG and the UBPC, the survey and its responses will help form proposals that will be presented directly to the President and Provost of the University. To improve the Northwestern experience for all, these proposals will cover important campus issues about mental health resources, academic resources, and more.

It is important that student priorities are accurately measured in order to make sure our proposals reflect what students really want to see changed at Northwestern. Please take 20 minutes to fill out the survey as winter quarter is starting up. Again the survey will close Friday January 9th at midnight.

Thank you, and good luck staying out of the cold as winter quarter starts!

Serendi Lau, UBPC member
