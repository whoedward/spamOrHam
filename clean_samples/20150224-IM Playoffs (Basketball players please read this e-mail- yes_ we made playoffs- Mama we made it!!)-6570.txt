Hi everyone,

I'm emailing everyone instead of just our IM players because playoff schedules have come out, which means if you weren't able to make it to the Monday 8 o clock bball games or the Thursday evening hockey games and still want to play, you may be able to make it to our playoffs!

So, go figure, we made playoffs for basketball. Here I was thinking I'd played my last bball game as IM chair of ISRC. Thanks for all your hard work this season- we're up against the #13 team in the league, "Medill", THIS SUNDAY, MARCH 1ST, AT 4:00 PM. I looked at their record, and I think this is definitely a very winnable game. I'll send out another email to remind you all, but if you are interested in playing this Sunday and haven't played with us before, please send me your netID ASAP. Looks like I'll have to buy more Gatorade lol.

I think it's a good idea to scrimmage this Saturday so we can get some plays and prepare for the game on Sunday. Here is a doodle link, please please fill out which times you are available to scrimmage.

As for floor hockey, we're #10 out of 16, and we're playing the same team we played last- we can definitely beat these guys. The game is THIS THURSDAY AT 6:30 PM -please meet promptly at 6 in the main lounge/lobby so we can catch the shuttle up. Again, anyone interested in playing that hasn't played before, send me your netID ASAP.

Thanks for a wonderful last season y'all. Let's finish strong.

Paul Kim
