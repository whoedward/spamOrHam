Hi guys,

For those who are testing this Sunday:

Bring your TOURNAMENT TEST APPLICATION FORM with  money to the Saturday practice! If you are not coming to the practice, make sure to bring it on Sunday!!

One more quick thing: WASH your uniform before the test!

Now, break your leg! (for exams and the test)

Best,
Natalie
