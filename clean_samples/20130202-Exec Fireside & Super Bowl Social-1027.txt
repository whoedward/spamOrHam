Hey everyone, 

Just a reminder: Tomorrow afternoon (sorry about the mistakes on the posters), we will have a fireside about the Exec Board in the main lounge at 4:45 p.m. If you are at all interested in or considering running for Exec, please come! We'll be talking about our individual positions, responsibilities, and commitments. Sarah sends this.

Join us afterward for a Super Bowl Social. As always, there will be food. 

No open exec tomorrow evening. 

Have a peaceful weekend. 

Hannah 

P.S. - Our people auction is now open for bidding! Go check it out! Some bids are open to ISRC residents only!
