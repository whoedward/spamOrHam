Do you like QUIZES? COOL! How about BOWLS (less important)? OK! Sign up with a team of four to compete in the year's only pan-Res College trivia competition. Each member of the winning team will receive the grand prize of a KINDLE FIRE. SAME GOES for the winner of the second annual SPELLING BEE, which will be held during the Quiz Bowl. 

And if that wasn't enough there will be FREE FOOD for all competitors. Snacks from PANERA and a late lunch from CHIPOTLE for ALL THE TEAMS.
