To those of you who have not filled out your schedules so far (8 of you):

Please fill out your schedules or request an extension. If you do not do so by 12 a.m., Pacific Time, You will not be placed on the schedule and will be at the mercy of your peers to obtain shifts. 

We need to produce a shift soon to ensure that people can make it to their first week shifts without conflicts or missing shifts. 

Thanks,
NTS Supervisors

    Hello NTS!

    Happy Holidays to all of you!

    New Tech Services Manager!

    Now that fall quarter is behind us, we need to start preparing for Winter Quarter. And with winter quarter, will come a new Tech Services Manager!

    As you know, Michael is now the Assistant Director for Event Production, but is continuing to do the tech manager job until a new one can be hired. 

    On January 6th, 7th, and 8th, the three candidates for the tech manager position will be on campus for interviews. Michael has given us (the students) a 45 minute time slot each day (from 2:45-3:30pm each day [subject to change]) to ask questions to each candidate. All techs are welcome and it is a great chance to ask questions about the future of tech and what you would like to ask a potential employer. 

    Also with winter quarter will be a remodeling of the lab! We will update you more on the process during weekly meetings. 

    Scheduling

    Like fall quarter, we will be using google docs to determine your availability throughout the quarter. 

    Instructions: Fill out the time slots for when you are busy (Classes, club meetings,etc.). The names are at the bottom; if you cannot find yours, please email Will (juwonhyun2016@u.northwestern.edu) and he will put a tab in for you. See the sample as a guideline. If there are shifts that you really prefer to work, mark those with an asterisk. We can't guarantee it, but we will try to accommodate

    Please be as honest as possible with your schedule. For example, if you have class from 11am-12pm and from 2pm-3pm, please do not that say you are unavailable for that entire block because you would like to get lunch/nap etc. in between.

    Also, please indicate how many hours you would like to work, if there is anything we need to know (if you are taking a quarter abroad, etc.). 

    THERE IS A HARD DEADLINE OF DECEMBER 26TH. If you do not turn in the schedule on time, we will give you the remaining shifts, and no one wants that to happen. 

    The Winter Quarter schedule will be updated on shiftplanning by New Year's Day. 
    Also note that our weekly meetings are at the same time, Wednesdays at 7pm. 

    If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.
