Hello Again Professor,

You mentioned today in class that team members should maintain a thorough and extensive project folder, which should be divided into several sections, The members of Team Four were wondering what, specifically, this meant. If you could please elaborate, that would be excellent.

Thank you for your time (yet again),
Team Four

Dear Team Four,
You would like you to get a three-ring binder and subdivide it into those categories as explained in Chapter 15 in the DTC textbook, which is one of the chapters assigned for reading for next Thursday, January 24th. If you still have questions, bring them to class on Thursday.

Regards,

Professor Herrick
