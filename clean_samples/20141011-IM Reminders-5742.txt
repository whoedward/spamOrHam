Hi all,
I still do not have a complete list of all players so.. you're all going to be getting these e-mails for a bit (sorry)

Just a few reminders: We are playing CRC in Football tomorrow, please wear WHITE and meet in the main lounge at 11:30 AM. 
We are playing "Ski Bums" in Volleyball at 3 tomorrow, please meet at 2:30 in the main lounge so we can go warm up at Blom.
Dodgeball we are playing Slivka at 7:30 on Tuesday, please meet at 7 sharp since we need to go over rules and hike it over to Patten. I'll send out another email for dodgeball.

I know I said I'd talk about practices, but only one person replied so we'll talk it out in person tomorrow. If you haven't sent me your netIDs yet and would like to continue to play, please send me your netIDs!!! Along with which sport(s)!

Thank you!! See you tomorrow! woop
Paul Kim
