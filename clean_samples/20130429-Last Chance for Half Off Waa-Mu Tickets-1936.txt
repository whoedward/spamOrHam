Hi guys,

Just reminding you that ISRC is offering tickets to the opening night of Waa-Mu, the annual NU show, at half price. Details below. If you want a ticket, email me before 1pm! 

NUâ€™s own original review, The Waa-Mu Show "Flying Home" on Friday, May 3, ~7:30-10:30

Subsidized price: $5

 

I probably don't have to tell you much about Waa-Mu. You could probably tell me about Waa-Mu, since it's the "greatest college show in America" and whatnot. All I know is it's a thing and you guys are supposed to go.

Anyways, this year's show imagines a world in which Wonderland, Oz, and Neverland collide. Under the direction of award-winning Northwestern faculty member David H. Bell, the journeys of Alice, Dorothy, and Wendy intersect and are woven together with a brand new fantasy of our own.

Following a group of young schoolboys who insert themselves into the stories and turn the tales upside down, Flying Home explores the things we learn while on the brink of adulthood, and how, if ever, we can return home. And we've got half off tickets for opening night, so you can be the one to tell your friends about it.


And be on the lookout for another email this week for a discounted trip to Wrigley!
