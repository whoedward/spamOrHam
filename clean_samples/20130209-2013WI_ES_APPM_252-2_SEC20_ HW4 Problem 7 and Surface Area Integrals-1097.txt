Class,

Many of you had trouble with problem 7, so I've written up and attached a solution for that problem. The details of how to solve the differential equations part of this problem are mostly there for your gratification, but I highly suggest that you review setting up the surface area and volume integrals parts, since these kinds of problems will appear on your midterm.

Have a nice weekend,

Karna
