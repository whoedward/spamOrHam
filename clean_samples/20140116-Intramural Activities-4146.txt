HEY
WE HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR A BASKETBALL TEAM (I THINK)
Ok so. As of right now we are playing basketball at 4 pm and floor hockey at 5/6 pm (which means it alternates between 5 and 6 pm) both on SUNDAYS

THIS SUNDAY

(JANUARY 19TH)

.

which happens to be the same day ISRC is going ice skating so.. we're not playing basketball this Sunday but we ARE playing hockey at 6. we need to wear WHITE SHIRTS to hockey. Meet at the lobby at 5:35 because it's at Patten.

bball is at Blom. we are by ourselves for bball and paired with Chapin for floor hockey, i'm not sure if that is good or bad news but i guess we will see on sunday. time to get real friendly with our humanities buddies

Rules for basketball if you are unfamiliar: http://nuim.northwestern.edu/rules.php?sport=Basketball

Similarly for floor hockey: http://nuim.northwestern.edu/rules.php?sport=Hockey

I'll be aware of the IM modifications so I'll know specifics when we play, and I'll let y'all know what to watch out for.

tl;dr:  HOCKEY THIS SUNDAY AT 6. WEAR WHITE SHIRTS. MEET AT LOBBY AT 5:35 BECAUSE IT'S AT PATTEN.

QUESTIONS? CONCERNS? COMMENTS? feel free to ask me anything. i was voted best at answering IM questions in my senior poll
