Hello Michael,

I am emailing in regards to the swipes for my hours on Friday. I was unsure as to whether or not I should swipe in/out, and ended up optin for not doing it. I was clocked in from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Hopefully this does not cause any trouble for you.

Have an excellent holiday,
Ethan Robison
