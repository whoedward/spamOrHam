Hey guys,

If you're going to formal tomorrow, READ THIS.

Buses for formal leave Cahn at 5:45 pm. Meet in the main lounge at 5:25pm where you will get your ticket from Hali. You MUST have your ticket in order to go, so make sure you don't lose it after you get it.

Can't wait for tomorrow, see you all there!
Thomas
