Hey NTS! 

As a follow up to our fall quarter training sessions, we are going to be doing further training with the training pamphlets that are hanging on the wall in the back of the lab. Also, the cubby shelf next to the pamphlets has been updated to include all of the new techs' names. This training is required for ALL techs. 

Procedure: Go through each pamphlet with a supervisor (Tim Perian, Ethan Robison, Christina Spaeth, Alex Yang, Alex Schlehuber, Will Hyun, Michael Wang) and have them sign off on each pamphlet indicating that you have completed the training. Then place the pamphlet in your cubby hole in the shelf.
 
Pamphlets to complete: Tier 1
1. Smart Room
2. McCormick Auditorium
3. Scholars Room
4. Conference Phones

All of these should be able to be completed within an hour. If you have a shift with a super, that's a great time to complete these. Otherwise, the schedule will change next quarter or you can schedule a time with a super. 

DUE DATE: January 16th (4 academic weeks from now)

Thanks,
NTS Supervisors
