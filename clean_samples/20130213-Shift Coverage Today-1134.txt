Hey guys,

Would anyone be willing to cover my 4-8pm shift today? I would LOVE to take a nap after my midterm/classes today after tonight's all-nighter and as I prepare for tomorrow's all-nighter. I would really, really appreciate it and of course return the favor barring any schedule conflicts.

Thanks,
Fadhi
