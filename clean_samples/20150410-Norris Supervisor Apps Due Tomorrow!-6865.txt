Hey NTS!

Supervisor and other leadership position applications are due TOMORROW.  If you're interested in a promotion (and pay raise/getting a bigger work study allotment), please get right on that.  I have been a supervisor for two years and it has been very rewarding.  I've developed a lot more confidence and leadership skills along with making some of my closest friends at NU.  

So get yourself on to Career Cat and apply!  If you have questions, email a supervisor.  

Best,
Christina

P.S.  Graduating seniors, I am sorry you can't apply.  We still love you.  This is for you: .
