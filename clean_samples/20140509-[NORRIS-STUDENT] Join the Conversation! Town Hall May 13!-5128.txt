Hi All!

The Student Employment Committee will host its last Town Hall of the academic year this coming Tuesday, May 13 at 4:30pm in Wildcat Room (Norris 101)!

This town hall will feature news on the future of a new University Center as well as the immediate future of Norris over the summer. If your area has events or news you would like to share with your fellow Norris staff, or if you are involved with exciting events on campus, this is a great place to share those. As always, we'll hold an open forum to discuss any questions or concerns you may have about the Norris Center.

Also, look out for a formal invitation to the Student Recognition Banquet, which will be held on Tuesday, May 27 at 6pm. Join us for this event where we'll recognize all you do for Norris throughout the year with a delicious dinner and awards presentation!

Hope to see you all soon!

Dominique
