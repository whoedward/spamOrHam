Hi Everyone, 

We will be handling all shift coverage for the rest of the quarter at the meeting tonight. With that said, it would considerably speed up this meeting if you could email me all your shifts you need covered BEFORE the meeting as well as releasing them on shiftplanning. If we can have a list of most of the shifts that need to be covered ready to go, we won't have to spend as much time at the meeting and it'll be easier on everyone. 

Please email me a list of all the shifts you need covered, especially if you won't be at the meeting tonight. Thanks everyone!
