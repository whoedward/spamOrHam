Hey guys,

I just wanted to let you know that I've set up a meeting time for our first Student Staff Development Committee meeting. It will be Tuesday, October 23 at 4pm in the Casbah room, that magical place within the Gameroom.  

We really want to have representation from every department, so I am asking you all as supervisors to talk to the other employees in your department to get at least one person to attend this meeting. Obviously, you all are welcome to be your department's representative. If you can't make it but still want to be involved, let me know.  It shouldn't last more than an hour.  You can clock in for this meeting as well. 

See you Tuesday! 

Love and all-encompassing Norris term,
Meredith
