I made a typo. The end date of assassins should be Sunday, February 9th at 9pm, not the entire month of February. :P

Props to Rohan for finding it!

    Greetings my assassins,

    The time for clandestine activity is drawing nearer! Here are the rules for this game of assassins. Read carefully, for I WILL NOT give you your target unless you answer the questions that are in the rules. I will tell everyone who has answered the questions properly their targets on Saturday.

    Let the coalitions/betrayals/chaos begin! (Soon...)

    Thomas
