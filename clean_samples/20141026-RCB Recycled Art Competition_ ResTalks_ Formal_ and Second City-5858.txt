    RCB Recycled Art Competition
    October 27 - November 7

    Celebrate Green cup with RCB this year! Increase environmental awareness by creating a unique piece of art composed only of recycled materials.

    Each res college will make one piece of art as a team. The piece must demonstrate ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle, and it must be displayed in the residential college with an explanation of its meaning.

    Trophies will be awarded for creativity and environmental content. 

    Contact your exec with ideas!
