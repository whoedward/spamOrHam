So, shiftplanning this week somehow has no one scheduled on any shift. I don't have any idea what's going on with how these shifts are set up on here (I think they're set to repeat daily or something instead of weekly?) Does anyone know what's going on? I'd be willing to help fix it if someone can tell me what the best way of going about that is.
