Hi everyone,

Our club has been asked to do a fireside on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and self-defense thursday night. It would be great if I could get one or more other people to join me to help demonstrate some moves. It is going to be thursday night at 7:30 for only about 30 minutes. Let me know if you're interested.

Thanks!
Jacob
