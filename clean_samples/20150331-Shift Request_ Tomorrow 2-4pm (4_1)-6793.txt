Hi everyone,

I just realized that I really need my shift covered tomorrow at 2-4pm. I messed up on my availability on my other job, and I just realized I'm working at that time as well. I tried to get my other job shift covered, but it looks like it won't get covered at all.

I'm sorry for the late notice everyone, but you would be a lifesaver if you could help me out and take this shift. I also released it on shiftplanning. Please let me know if you can take it!

Thanks!
Magan
