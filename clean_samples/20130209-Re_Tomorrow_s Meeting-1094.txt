Will asked when our elections would end, I'm going to send my response to all of you, remember to "reply all" and not just "reply" in this email so everyone can see the discussion.

Fd: "All night; we have about 13 positions to fill and all the candidates give a speech then we discuss among ourselves before every vote. After that we have our normal education and chapter sessions, so I expect it won't end until ~9:00.

Another option would be to meet on Monday rather than tomorrow seeing as we don't have class until Tue."

        How long will the elections last? I would personally prefer to postpone the meeting to 4 instead, rather than meet 2.5 hours earlier.
