Hey guys, tomorrow's IFN will be "The Motorcycle Diaries." It's a biographic film about Che Guevara, a Marxist revolutionary.

Come check it out at 7pm in the basement/main lounge!


Also, we still have a few spots available if anybody is interested in coming to the Chicago Botanical Gardens on Saturday from 10:30-3pm (or 5pm).

Thanks,
Kyle
