WARNING: YOU MAY HAVE GOT THIS ALREADY. READ IT AGAIN ANYWAY!

Howdy folks,

Hope your Spring Quarters are starting out well! I don't want to proverbially rain on the proverbial parade, but I have some Senator stuff that I need your opinions on! 

Everybody knows that crossing Sheridan rd. in front of Hinman is a deathtrap. Mostly because we refuse to cross at the crosswalk, cause its like...30 extra steps, amirite? Well, a resolution is proposing adding another crosswalk to solve this problem!

The ideal crosswalk would go from in front of CRC to mid-Hinman, basically where we all already cross. HOWEVER. According to the top Evanston Traffic Engineer, that would never happen ever, because it would make us cross without looking(his words, not mine). 

So the proposed idea is to instead add a second crosswalk to the intersection at Hinman Ave. and Sheridan. There is one already there on the west side, but not the east-that's where the resolution wants it. Now in case your thinking "Why would we put 2 crosswalks in one intersection? THATS INSANE!", this is actually pretty common, there's some up by Tech in fact.

I want to stress this isn't asking for money or anything like that, its merely a resolution asking the city to think about it(basically). 

So, please let me know your opinions on it! That way I can vote how you guys want me too. If you don't let me know via some form of communication (10 points to anyone who sends a scroll), then don't complain! 

Thank you for reading,

Eric Morales
