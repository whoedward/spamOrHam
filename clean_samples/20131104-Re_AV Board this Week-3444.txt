I vote not wasting time with permanent shift changes unless people actually can't make it to work, they aren't getting covered if they haven't before now. I'm in the process of going over the AV board and putting everything up on shiftplanning so you guys can just plug in names at the meeting. Also, we are going to need an extra tech (preferably a supervisor) on shift this Saturday from probably 5pm (or maybe a bit earlier) until at least the start of the karaoke event to help set up. It's three projectors and about 10 microphones in Louis, and the people on shift are probably going to need some help with that. Unfortunately I can't do it, but if one of you could take that if you're available, that would be great.

Tim and Alex, I know you won't be there, but if you see anything you can take for even a couple hours I think that would be really helpful.  That goes for other supers too; anything we can get done before the meeting would be good.  Here's the meeting notes: just write your name on this Google Doc.
