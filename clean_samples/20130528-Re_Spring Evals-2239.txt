            Hello Everyone!

            It's that time again!  Everyone must complete a Spring Evaluation in order to qualify for a (drumroll please...) 5 cent raise!  At least I think it's 5 cents...

            But you must do your eval!  IT SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AT THE MOST.  Wednesday is my designated day this week:  if you would like to just blast this thing out of the way, I will available:

            Wednesday, 5/29
            2-4 pm
            6-7 pm
            8-9 pm

            Email me with a time (and reply all so that we don't overlap), and I'll meet you in the Tech Lounge.

            Let's get pumped people!

            Marina
