Hey NTS,

We've revised the schedule a little bit, so please check and make sure you know what shifts you were assigned to. The schedule is effective tomorrow, and if you want to trade shifts, we can get that done at the meeting on Wednesday.

    Hey guys,

    The first draft of the spring schedule has been posted to Shiftplanning - please check it and make sure that there are no conflicts. If you have any complaints/conflicts please email me and we'll work it out.

    Thanks,

    Alex

        Hi everyone,

        I hope you've had a good break so far. As a reminder, please fill out your availability on shiftplanning for spring quarter and fill out the Google Doc we sent out last week so we can get the spring schedule out.

        Thanks,

        Alex

            Hi everyone, I hope your finals went well.

            Also, make sure that you have updated your availability on Shiftplanning - we will make the schedule based off the times you give us. As a reminder, make sure that you indicate the times you will be unavailable due to a scheduled conflict, such as class, meeting etc. Don't mark that you're unavailable during the weekends, mornings etc just because you don't want to work those shifts. We will do our best to make sure you get the shifts that you want.

            Thanks,
