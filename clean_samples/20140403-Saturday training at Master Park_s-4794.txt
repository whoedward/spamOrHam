Hey all,
 
Last practice, we talked about bringing in a guest instructor for exposure to different teaching styles. It seemed everyone was on board to opening a few Saturday practices for guest instruction.
 
Master Park has invited us to train at his school this Saturday for a special training session with his competition team class. We should get there at 10:45 am, and training will be 11am-12:30pm. From what I understand, this will be an intense sparring-oriented practice, but he's also willing to watch/critique poomsae afterwards. I think this will be great chance to train and spar with new people, as well as get exposure to a different teaching style.
 
His dojang is at: 
9245 Waukegan Rd.
Morton Grove, IL 60053 (a 15 min drive from campus)
 
I understand Eric is willing to give a ride to those of us that can fit in his car.
 
Also, we also have the upcoming KASA show demo to actively prepare for. Those that go to Master Park's training session should be able to make it back to Blomquist around 1-1:15 to practice for the KASA show.
 
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns! And bring your sparring gear! If we need to, we can probably stop by Blomquist to gather any gear we'll need.

Best,
Andrew
