Hello everyone,

Thanks for filling out the doodle! Based on the responses, the time that works best is Wednesday @ 2 pm in Norris. Let's meet at the steps going up to McCormick and we will find a place to sit after. Savannah: unfortunately you are the one person who is not available during that time; it's not ideal but Justin said he is available until 2:45, so he will go as the props representative. I sent you a separate message about this, but if you want to meet with Nikolaj separately just to touch base that would be great.

The purpose of this meeting is to coordinate all of the show's primary visual elements, both artistically and logistically, so just come prepared with notes on initial designs and any pertinent questions for other designers.

Elise, Natalie, Ashley, Ethan and Sylvia: we would love for all of you to be there as well if you are available, just so everyone can be as cued in as possible!

Let me know if there are any questions/concerns!

All the best,
Matt

    Hi guys,

    As promised, here is an email to set up a four-way meeting this week between set, lights, props and costumes to talk about color palettes/visuals. Please fill out this Doodle by Monday at midnight. These dates are based on when Maia is free this week. Our goal is to be able to settle on a date when all lead designers are available, and then choose a date when the most assistant designers are free because we would love to keep everyone in the loop as much as possible.

    Thanks everyone! Let me know if you have any questions.

    All the best,
    Matt
