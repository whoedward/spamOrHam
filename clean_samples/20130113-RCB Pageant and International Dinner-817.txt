As a collaboration between philanthropy and social interests, RCB is putting on the first RCB Pageant to find our 2013 Mr. or Ms. RCB.
The basic idea of the Pageant is that each RC will have one competitor (for a total of 11) who will go through certain segments (talent/skit, dance off, spirit wear, Q&A) for a final winner while also promoting Dance Marathon and raising money for the RC's teams. The event is planned to be on Saturday, March 2nd at McCormick Tribune Center at 7pm.

The commitments are as follows:
- Attend pageant participant meeting(s) (~30 mins)
- Come up with talent/skit
- Sign up a slot for an individual rehearsal on 2/24 (~15 mins)
- Complete dress rehearsal (before show) and actual show on 3/2 (we will provide dinner) (~3 hours)
- Being professional

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE, PLEASE EMAIL ME ASAP! We will then have a in dorm online vote to determine who will be ISRC's representative.

Also, International Dinner is this quarter, on February 24th. International Dinner is ISRC's annual formal. Instead of a ticket, each person (or with a friend) is required to make a dish. When the time comes, you will send me your recipe and I will purchase the ingredients for you. Save the date!

Cheers,
SB
