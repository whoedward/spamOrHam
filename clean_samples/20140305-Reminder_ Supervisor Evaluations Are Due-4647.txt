Good evening everyone,

Thank you to all who finished your assigned evaluations.  You will be receiving them and your corresponding students' self-assessments in the next few days.  The information will be sent as a Microsoft Excel file with an attached form.  Please be sure to enable macros when you open the file.  If you do not have access to a Windows or Mac computer with Microsoft Excel, please consult with your full-time staff supervisor to see if a machine is available with this program.  If you do have the program, but are having trouble viewing the form, please reply to this email as soon as possible.

For those of you who are still working on the evaluations of your assigned students, please get them completed and submitted as soon as possible.  March 1st was a soft deadline for you because we new that some supervisors had multiple evaluations to complete.  The deadline for all supervisor evaluations is 11:59pm Friday, March 7th.  Is possible, please use the link originally sent to you.  If you are unable to locate that email, we've included the link below.

Best regards,


Norris Student Employment Committee
