Hey Hannah,

I am not sure what the specific issue might be, but keep in mind that there are now two Louis South boxes (I think that I forgot to take the dud out of the booth). One of them works perfectly. Be sure to double check your connections as well!

If more problems arise, give one of us a call.

    Hannah,

    Did you contact a Supervisor about the connection to the projector in Louis.  Ethan had tested the box on Friday and it was working 100%.  Can you please follow up with Ethan.
