Hi,
I need my Cont. Ed shift covered. Its on Thurs 2/26 and from 11-1:30. I know that it is at an awkward time, and I really just need the last hour covered because I have a midterm at 1 (if that helps).
I also can't make the meeting tonight because I desperately need to study for my chem midterm tomorrow.

Thanks,
Mikayla Smith
