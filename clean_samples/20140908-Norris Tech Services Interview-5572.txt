Hi Kayla,

Last Spring you applied for a position at Norris Tech Services. Unfortunately, we did not have any positions available during that time.

Fortunately, we are now looking for a new group of employees. If you are still interested in the position, we would love to arrange an interview with you some time in the next few weeks.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
