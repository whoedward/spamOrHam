Hi all,
Thanks again for those of you that signed up for IM sports this quarter.
We're playing Slivka this coming Monday at 8pm. Let's meet in the main lounge at 7:30 so we can go over the rules and then head over together. Remember, there are no classes on Monday.
Our first floor hockey match is against CCI at 7:30 this Thursday. Let's meet at 7 in the main lounge to go over rules and then hustle up to Patten. Please wear WHITE for this match. I'll send more emails to remind you all.

Looking forward to working with y'all this quarter.
Paul Kim
