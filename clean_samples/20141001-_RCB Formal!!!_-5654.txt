Hello ISRC,

I'm very excited to announce that this year's Residential College Board (RCB) Formal will be held at the Field Museum! 

The formal will be on Nov. 14th, starting at 8pm. Tickets are $15 and transportation will be provided. 

Tickets are not officially on sale right now, but will be soon. I am sending out a google form to see how many people are interested in attending the formal. 

Don't worry if you don't know yet, or if you change your mind later. This is just to give me a rough estimate of how many tickets ISRC can sell. 

The link for the form is here:

Please respond by the end of the week. 

Thank you!

ISRCLove,
Esteban
