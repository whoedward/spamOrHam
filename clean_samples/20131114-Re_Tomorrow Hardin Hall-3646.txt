Awesome!

Am I invloved with this?
My schedule has become strangely full over the last few days and I'm having trouble keeping things in line.

    Hey Ethan!

    I emailed Michael about that Hardin Hall thing tomorrow.  It is the set-up that we're doing and he's going to help us because it's a weird one.  We're going to meet at the lab at 5 to get equipment and we can get into the venue around 5:30.  It should take about an hour.
