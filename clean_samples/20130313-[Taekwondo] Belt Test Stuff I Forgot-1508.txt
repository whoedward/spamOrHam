Hey everyone,

So I forgot to mention a few things in my last email. First, the belt test starts at 8:30. That means that testing actually begins at 8:30, so be at Blom earlier (8 or so) to get warmed up beforehand.

Also, even if you aren't testing, feel free to come to support your fellow club members.
