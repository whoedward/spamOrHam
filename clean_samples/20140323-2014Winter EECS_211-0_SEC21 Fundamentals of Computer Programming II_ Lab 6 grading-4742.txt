Hi all.

I have entered your lab 6 grades to blackboard. Please check your grades. If you have any kind of objections, please first DOWNLOAD the code you have submitted to blackboard and then run it with the test input I have provided (check blackboard \ documents \ grading inputs used)

Your grading also included matrix comparison operators (!= and ==). So you can just check whether these functions work by yourselves by providing different matrices. You use the same matrices I have provided in the grading input and do these comparisons:

cv1 == cv5 , cv1 == cv4 , cv2 == cv3 , cv1 != cv5 , cv1 != cv4 , cv2 != cv3

Before making an objection, please be sure you have done these tests and be sure that the code files you have used are the ones that you have UPLOADED to blackboard.

I have seen cases where you claimed your program works perfectly well but I could not even compile them. For those cases, if you are sure that your code is correct (although I think the opposite because I specifically checked your codes and seen what the problem is, but there is still a chance that I may be wrong), then please contact me as soon as possible (amg@u.northwestern.edu). The deadline for entering grades is 3PM on Monday, so we can have an objection session until 2PM on Monday.
