Hi everyone,

Sorry for the late notice but my chamber music coach had some last minute schedule changes so he moved back our rehearsal time..
so I can't help Ethan with cleaning up Fisk today.
Can someone please help him? The show starts at 4 PM so.. you just have to go there around 5 PMish and take everything down.

Thank you!
