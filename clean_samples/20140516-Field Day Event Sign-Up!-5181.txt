Hey ISRC,

Here is the sign-up for RCB Field Day events. It is super important for us to get as many participants as possible. I have attached the list of event descriptions for you to read. 

Please remember that there is more stuff to do at Field Days than these events. These are just the events that are for points. But there is also an obstacle course, a bounce house, AND there will be an opportunity to throw water balloons at me! If you have any questions let me know. 

Sign-up here:

You have until Monday (5/19) night at MIDNIGHT to sign up. 

Best,
