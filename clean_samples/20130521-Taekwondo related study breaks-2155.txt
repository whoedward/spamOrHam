SO! If you're like me, doing homework at 3am thinking "I could really use a Taekwondo related study break"... LOOK NO FURTHER... My studio's big May fundraiser was on the 19th (we raised over $15,000 for Wounded Warrior Project) and these are the links to some of the instructor breaking demos, and the instructor skit. 
(ps. I will look for Taekwondo related study breaks to send out next school year, because, hey, it's more fun than doing work)
