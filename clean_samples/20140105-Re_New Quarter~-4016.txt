        Hey, guys,

        Hope you all had a good break from school and that you guys are taking care of yourselves in this brutal cold.

        We are tentatively scheduled to have our first practice tomorrow, January 6th during our regular practice time (8 - 10 P.M.). If the gyms close down because of the weather, we will unfortunately have to cancel practice.

        Master Kallo will not be here for this first week, so we will run the practices ourselves :)

        There are a couple things I wanted to bring up with all of you, which I will bring up again during our first practice. The officers and some of the other club members were thinking of asking BTMA for instruction from other masters as well. This would hopefully bring more variety and freshness to our practices. We were also thinking of dividing our current two-hour practices on Mondays and Wednesdays to two one-hour sessions, one for the color belts and one for the black belts. We hope this would allow each member to receive the appropriate attention and challenge at his or her skill level. If this is to be implemented, practices would likely be a lot more compressed.

        Obviously, there are still some details to be worked out, and we still need to ask Master Baek about all this. But we just wanted to know what you guys thought before making any moves. Let me or Natalie know through email or personally when you see us. Thanks!

        Yours,
        Davin
