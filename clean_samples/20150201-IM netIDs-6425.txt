Hi all,
Hopefully this'll be the last e-mail I'll be sending out to the whole listserv, but I'm sending this out to notify you that if you are interested in playing in either basketball or floor hockey, I need your netID. Please email me your netID along with which sport you want to play.

Please note also that we are playing basketball tomorrow night. Please meet in the main lounge at 7:30 so we can head over together and warm up.

Paul
