    Hey Ethan,

    I would have time during my shift Thursday morning, sometime between 8am and 12pm. If that does not work we could talk after or before the meeting tomorrow.

        Hi Evan,
        Just wondering if you have any time over the next week to sit down for about fifteen minutes and talk. It can be while you're on shift or otherwise. Let me know your availability.

        Regards,
