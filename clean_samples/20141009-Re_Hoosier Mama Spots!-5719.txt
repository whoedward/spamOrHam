Spots are now completely filled. Thank you all so much for your enthusiasm. I think it'll be a great first social.

If you'd still like to come, send me an email and I'll put you on a waitlist. Related, if you find you can no longer come, please let me know so i can inform the waitlist.

My phone number is 334-750-9141 in case an emergency happens; please put this in your address book if you haven't already.
