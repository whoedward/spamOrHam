First-year students (freshmen and new transfers),
I hope your move-in has been going well. It was great meeting you all today! Remember, meet in the FIRST FLOOR LOUNGE AT 4:45pm TODAY for dinner first and a meeting after (this is in your schedule book, but the location is not mentioned). We will go over rules, meet each other, and do lots of other fun things! 
See you there,
Matt

**Returning students, you are encouraged but not required to come if you want to meet all the new students
