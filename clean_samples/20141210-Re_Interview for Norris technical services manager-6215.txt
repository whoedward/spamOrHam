Hey Michael,

Do you mind sending a Calendar invite out? It helps a bundle.

    Hello,

     

    The three candidates we chose will be on campus on the 6th, 7th and 8th.  The committee interview will take place from 12:45 till 1:45.

    Alex and Ethan if you can’t make that portion, try to go to the student portion at 1:45-2:30pm.

     

    Thanks,

     

     

    Michael
