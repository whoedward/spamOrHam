He came in about 10 minutes after 12pm under the impression that he did not work until noon. It was a mistake of poor planning on his part, and I made him aware that we will have to sit down with him to discuss the issue.

    Can you send him an email, asking why he wasn't there?  Then let me know when your office hours are and we'll ask him to come in and we will deal with it.

    Michael,

    Jake was supposed to take today's open (covering for Max as per the meeting notes) but he was not here today. I believe this makes it his final warning since he is on probation.

    From,
