Hello Professor Abrams,

I apologize if you have already posted something regarding this, but I have a concern with the daily question. When I computed it, I found the value to be (i + j - 7k). However, the answer recorded on Blackboard was different. I double-checked my work, and used wolframalpha to double-check that work, and the answers are consistent, and do not agree with the answer on the site. I apologize if I am speaking out of turn, and just wanted to mention the issue to you. 

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
