That is alright. I should let you that I also signed up for the 6 to 8 shifts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

    Hey man, sorry about that. It should be editable now. Christina had already requested a few of those shifts but you got all of the ones that are still available during the times you requested.

        Hey Bobby,

        I would like to sign up for the 8-12 (closing) shifts on Monday through Sunday; however, the document will not permit me to edit. If there is something that I need to do differently, please let me know. Otherwise, if you do the editing, those are the slots that I would like 9if they are available, of course).

        Best,
        Ethan

            Hey everyone,

            From this point on, we'll be sending the meeting notes out to the full listserv rather than just the summer techs so that everyone is in the loop as we approach the school year. 

            Starting September 16th, we will be returning to regular building hours (8am-12am). We will be carrying over the regular summer schedule, but we are still in need of techs to sign up for some of the shifts that have opened up. 

            Below is the link to the summer schedule google doc that the summer crew has been using. Anyone is welcome to sign up for any of the open shifts listed on the "Welcome Week" tab. Please email me if you do sign up.

            We will also be sending out a google doc in order to collect everyone's availability for shifts during the regular school year soon. 

            Along with this, we will have a MANDATORY ALL STAFF MEETING, FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 20TH in order to go over the permanent school year shifts. More info to come.

            Sorry for the long email. Hope your summers have been great. 

            -Bobby Ramirez
