Hi all, 

There is a really awesome educational event this Thursday in Harris 107 at 7:30PM on "Discover Islam" that I was thinking we could go to. You will get an academic point for attending and free ice cream afterwards. Please send me an email if you are looking to attend. Good luck with your midterms and classes!

Best,
Danny

Based on his research with Gallup,
Who Speaks for Islam? What A Billion Muslims Really Think

John Esposito is a devout Catholic, and renowned professor of International Affairs and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University. He earned a PhD at Temple University, Pennsylvania in 1974, and held postdoctoral appointments at both Harvard and Oxford. He is well known as a promoter of respecting diversity, and encouraging strong ties among faith groups and has challenged the Vatican to make greater efforts to sustain such ties. He is currently Vice President (2012) and President Elect (2013) of the American Academy of Religion. The co-author of Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think, his work is based on years of research and more than 50,000 interviews representing 1.3 billion Muslims who reside in more than 35 nations that are predominantly Muslim or have sizable Muslim populations. Representing more than 90% of the world's Muslim community, it makes this poll the largest, most comprehensive study of its kind.
