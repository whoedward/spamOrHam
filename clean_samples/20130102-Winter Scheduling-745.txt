Hi NTS,

I hope you've had a good holiday season and a great new year. More importantly, I hope you all watched NU kick butt yesterday. Winter Quarter is starting up soon however, and we need to get a schedule going for the quarter.

We sent out the Google Doc for Winter availability before the break, thanks to everybody who's filled it out so far.

Here's the Google Doc link again.

Please fill out the form by Saturday, January 5th by noon.

We will get out a schedule soon after everybody's filled out the form.

If you have any problems filling out the Google Doc, don't hesitate to email me.

Thanks,

Alex
