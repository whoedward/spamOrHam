Hey Brian, 

I'm not seeing that on my shiftplanning, and I checked with the other supers to see if they changed it, and it's listed as you and Adrick, so I'm not sure what the discrepancy was. 

Regardless, the shift is still yours.

    Hello,

    On shiftplanning, tomorrow’s 4-6 has Adrick and Mikayla, even though I don’t remember giving up that shift. It should be Adrick and me on shift from 4-6. 

    Thanks.
