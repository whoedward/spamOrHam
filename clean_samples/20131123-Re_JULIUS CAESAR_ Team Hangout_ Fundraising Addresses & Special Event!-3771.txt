    Hello most puissant Caesar cast and team,

    Hope you are all having a wonderful week! A couple of important things:

    1) TEAM HANGOUT – We will be hanging out as a team this Saturday @ 8 pm at 2000 Sherman Ave. We will drink, eat, bond and watch a Shakespeare movie adaptation! Feel free to come late if need be! 

    2) FUNDRAISING ADDRESSES – Please fill out this form with a minimum of two mailing addresses and two email addresses of family/friends by this Sunday's prod meeting!
    https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1uwAOViA7Crmv_g-GFG7VZLRExC0jd0_iKL6dfseuCqU/viewform

    3) SPECIAL EVENT – We are planning a special event for the show for the evening of December 4th! It is going to be a comedic roast (a la Comedy Central's roast of James Franco) of CAESAR, the course scheduling website. We will charge $2 for the event, and there will be food and laughs! We are still working on filling a lineup of 6-7 roasters, an MC and someone to play CAESAR (the website), who will "rebut" at the end. The roasters will prepare 5-7 minutes of material dissing CAESAR. If you know any student comedians who might be interested, let me know! OR if you yourself want to diss CAESAR let me know! 

    That's it for now! As always, email me with questions, concerns or cries of outrage!

    All the best,
    Matt
