    Sorry Kara, Tim P. has 8:55...  I can still a little after 9 pm, though!  These things should seriously take no more than 5 minutes.

    For simplicity's sake, I'll lay out those signed up for today:

    2:00 pm - Max Zhang
    2:15 pm - Juan Herrera
    2:30 pm -
    2:45 pm -
    3:00 pm -
    3:15 pm -
    3:30 pm -
    3:45 pm -
    6:00 pm -
    6:15 pm -
    6:30 pm - Ryan Littlefield
    6:45 pm - Athif W.
    8:00 pm - Will Worden
    8:15 pm - Aliyah Lee
    8:30 pm - Charlie Hoffert
    8:45 pm - Matt Connor
    8:55 pm - Tim P.

    Let me know if I've misplaced or overlooked anybody.  As you can see, there's still some spots left, especially between 2-4 pm.  Thanks for all the cooperation, guys!

        Is 8:55 a thing that can happen?

                        Could I grab the Wednesday 6:30pm spot?

                            This is great everyone, keep 'em coming (and remember to "REPLY ALL" so we don't overlap!). 

                            I like how everyone is keeping at least a 15-minute interval in between every appointment--please continue to do so. 

                            Also, FYI:  Max Zhang has the 2:00 pm--the next available time should be around 2:15, all the way until 4 pm (I have a section at this time).

                            Again people, keep up the good work!

                            Thanks,

                                            It's that time again!  Everyone must complete a Spring Evaluation in order to qualify for a (drumroll please...) 5 cent raise!  At least I think it's 5 cents...

                                            But you must do your eval!  IT SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AT THE MOST.  Wednesday is my designated day this week:  if you would like to just blast this thing out of the way, I will available:

                                            Wednesday, 5/29
                                            2-4 pm
                                            6-7 pm
                                            8-9 pm

                                            Email me with a time (and reply all so that we don't overlap), and I'll meet you in the Tech Lounge.

                                            Let's get pumped people!
