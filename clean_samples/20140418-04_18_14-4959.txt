Hey, guys,

Just a couple of things:

1) Good luck to Andrew and Joanna as they compete at the Cardenas Tae Kwon Do Tournament tomorrow.

2) For those who are not going to the tournament, there is still practice tomorrow for those who want to practice and a preparation time for the KASA Show.

3) Elections for leadership positions next year will take place May 19th (Monday). Mark that date and really try to come out to practice then to vote for new officers. More information to follow.

That's about it. See you guys tomorrow.

Yours,
Davin
