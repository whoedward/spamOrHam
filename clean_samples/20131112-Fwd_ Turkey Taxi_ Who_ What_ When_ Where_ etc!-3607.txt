Hi all!

Here's some information about a really great philanthropy event that RCB is sponsoring. The Turkey Taxi program allows for RCB to assist a lot of Evanston families in having a nice Thanksgiving dinner, as they could not normally afford or be able to provide one on their own. Please email me or Ayla (aylagoktan2012@u.northwestern.edu) if you are interested in signing up to help. Thanks! Have a lovely evening!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan

TURKEY TAXI FAQ

WHO? All of you lovely humans that are members of Residential Colleges are invited to participate. The recipients are families in Evanston who would not otherwise be able to buy/provide for a thanksgiving dinner.
WHAT?: This is a Turkey Taxi. We're gonna build these.
NO, SERIOUSLY. WHAT? 1-2 representatives of each residential college are going to go down to Jewel Osco. They're going to spend $50 on food items that go in a Thanksgiving dinner. In the meanwhile, anyone who wants to come will meet up to decorate paper bags and make some cards wishing happy holidays to the families. The grocery-shoppers will come back and help fill each bag with their purchases. At the end, we'll deliver the packed up bags of food and good feelings to Family Focus, who will distribute those bagged dinners to the people that need them.
WHEN?: Sunday, November 24th.  Shoppers will meet as specified parking lots and at particular times, TBA. For decorators, please drop in and join us between 11 am - 2 pm at
WHERE?: The Lake Room at Norris!
WHY?: Honestly, because the people who will be receiving these dinners will appreciate it so much. And because you're good people. And because Thanksgiving. 

Please email your Philanthropy Chairs to sign up to go shopping or to come decorate!
