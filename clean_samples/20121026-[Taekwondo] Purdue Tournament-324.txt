Hey everyone,

I wanted to get an official headcount of people who are planning to go to the Purdue tournament. The tournament is on November 10th and is 20 bucks to compete in forms, sparring, or both. The minimum belt ranking we require to compete is yellow belt, but there is no requirement for spectating. We'll be leaving for Purdue early that morning and getting back at around 10 PM.

So, who wants to go win glory and honor for our club? :)
