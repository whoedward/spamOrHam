Hi All,

A minor detail for everyone about sheets: if you're on the close, take the sheets with you to the Louis Booth. Stow the keys in the cabinet and put the set of sheets back in the corresponding day.
In other words, the slot with that day's name on it.

Super simple stuff! Email me or any of the other supers if you have questions.
