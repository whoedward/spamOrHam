Hi everyone!

My name is Matt Du.

Welcome/welcome back to ISRC (International Studies Residential College, aka West Fairchild)! I hope your summers have been awesome and that you are ready for the school year to start! 

As you may be aware, you will be living on the 3rd floor, and I just want to let you know that I will be your CA (community assistant), which is not a bad thing!

Here's a picture of me so you will be able to recognize me when you move in:


Also, there are 2 other CAs for ISRC: Halimah Jones (1st floor) and Maytal Mark (2nd floor). 

This year, we will have so many fun events not only as a hall (aka dorm, but you're not allowed to say the word dorm because dorm implies a place where only eating, studying, and sleeping occurs, and ISRC is obviously much more than that!), but as a neighborhood/area (ISRC is one of several halls that resides in the J1F Area, which consists Jones Residential College, 1835 Hinman, and West and East Fairchild (ISRC and CRC, respectively)!

Guys, I can't wait to meet you all, and I am confident we will have a great year at ISRC!

Your future buddy,
Matt
