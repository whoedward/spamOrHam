She said it's a Mac computer. So, should we be fine to set up around 12pm at 640 Lincoln on Thursday? Is there anything I should do to prepare?

    Let me check. I am pretty sure it is a Mac. Noon Thursday is fine.

    See you then.

    Also, is it a Mac? He'll need to recode a bit if it isn't a mac.

                    Hi Kylee,


                    We have a desktop, desk and space for your piece. I think the laptop was a little risky. Hope that's ok. What is the title and material list for the piece? Josh is going to type a label. Let me know when you can make it on Thursday and we'll get you set up.


                    Best,

                    Allison

                    Hi Allison,
                    Is there a title for the piece? I'd love to put a card identifying artist/title/matierals (or whatever she'd like to include)

                        The desktop should be fine! I'll double-check but let's plan on that.

                        Thanks again to you and Matt

                        I talked to Matt and we identified a small room on the second floor in the wing where Walter's studio is. Would it work to use a desktop iMac with a keyboard/mouse? I don't have a way to secure our laptops (mac air's did not include a "kensington" slot).

                            Cool - I have a desk that should work. I still need to work out a spot with Matt, but we'll find something appropriate.

                                It runs mainly using terminal (on any computer) and Sublime Text 2. I would just need a Mac laptop and a simple desk. I would love it if you could locate a loaner for me.

                                    That's great news.  I imagine you would want a laptop to run the piece and a desk/chair?  What program does it run on?  I can see if we have a loaner laptop so you don't have to use/leave yours. 

                                    Let me know!

                                    I'm terribly sorry for the delay in response. I had to check with Frank (Ethan Robinson), and he said he would love to put it on display. We would be incredibly excited to show our project; is it too late to get this started? 

                                    Thank you, 
                                    Kylee Grant

                                            Hi Kylee,

                                            Hope your quarter is going well.  I am writing to see if you and your collaborator wanted to put your final piece from sculpture last quarter in the Art Department open house taking place March 6 from 10-5.  If you are interested, we can discuss the possibility of finding a loaner laptop.

                                            Best,
                                            Allison
