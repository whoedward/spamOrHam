Hello!

I was checking Shiftplanning, since Hannah wanted to give away this particular shift that's in the subject line (her travel plans changed). But I looked and it lists you on there just for that day.  Is this correct that you wanted to work this shift?  If not, please let us know right away so we can get it covered.

Thank you!
Christina
