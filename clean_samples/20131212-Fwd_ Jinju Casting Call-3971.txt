Hello Davin,

My name is George Fan and I am the casting director for an upcoming Senior Directing Program student short film called Jinju. The Director of this film is Crystal Kim, and she is a good friend of Ji-Hoon Kim. We were hoping that you might forward this casting call to the TKD club to see if anyone might be able to reach out to any people who might be interested in auditioning for any of the roles of this film.

The film is a story about a Korean American mother and her daughter. The casting calls in English and Korean are attached.

We are hoping for a lot of interest, and all levels of experience are welcome to audition.

Please email us at jinju.film@gmail.com if you have any questions! Thank you so much.

Best,

George
