Hello,

I am Ethan Robison with the McCormick Student Advisory Board. We are looking to improve the student group experience for McCormick students, and are hoping to get in touch with a number of different groups.

Particularly, I have been trying to find contact information for NU's chapter of KTE, and have had trouble doing so. With that in mind, is there a generic or specific email that I can use to get in touch with a representative of the organization?

Thank you in advance for your help. If there is any other information that you need, please let me know.

Best,

--
