Hello ISRC,

I just wanted to take some time to wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving, and safe travels for those of you who are going home.

For the people who are staying in ISRC for the holiday, I wanted to let you know that we plan to have the ISRC dinner ready by 3pm tomorrow. From the survey sent out earlier, we expect about 14 people. If your plans changed from what you said in the survey, please let me know so we can have the table set.

Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!!

ISRCLove,
Esteban
