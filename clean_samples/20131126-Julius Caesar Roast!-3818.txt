Hey cast/crew/everyone,

Another email from me! These will get more frequent in the coming weeks so I apologize now for the barrage. Now, onto business: 

We are having a Roast of Caesar next Wednesday the 4th (the scheduling website, not the dictator) and a Jamba Juice fundraiser on the 3rd. Basically, the roast is going to mirror a comedy central roast, and the jamba juice fundraiser just involves going to jamba juice and saying Julius Caesar and a portion of your drink will go to the show. Both will serve as a publicity/fundraising events as well as good times. However, they will accomplish none of these things if no one attends. So, we have a publicity push happening to get the word out. Here's what you have to do: 

1. Change your FB profile picture and/or cover photo to one of the attached images at 9pm tomorrow night (Nov. 27). If you are back home enjoying the presence of your families, just change it whenever you have time. 
2. In the description of the photo, link to the event for the Roast (which I will send you tomorrow.)
3. Over the next week, talk up the event both in person and on all your favorite social media. Post one (or two or ten) statuses with links to both the roast and the jamba fundraiser. Some fun details to include: there will be free mac and cheese at the roast (what?! I know, this is real. Shout out to Brooke), there will be student comedians, and it's only $2! As for Jamba, who doesn't love a cold smoothie in winter?! 

That's all for now! I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and a refreshing reading week. 

Kyle 

PS Please respond to my merch email if you haven't! Thanks to all who already did.
