Hello supervisors.  Sorry I haven't been around for awhile.  I have 4 big shows coming up in the next 4 weeks so scheduling things have been pretty hectic.  Anyways, I have a project meeting for a class tomorrow from 6-8 so I won't be able to make the meeting unless it gets out early.  

Thanks
 - Jolo
