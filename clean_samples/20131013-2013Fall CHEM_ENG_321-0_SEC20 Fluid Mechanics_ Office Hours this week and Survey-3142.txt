All, two things:

1.) Prof. Burghardt is out of town until Thursday. I'll be holding office hours this week. They will be as follows:

Wednesday (10/16/13): 12:30 to 1:30 in the ChBE Conference Room (E133)

Thursday (10/17/13): 12 to 1 in the TA Office (E225)

If those times don't work, feel free to make an appointment (ksekar@u.northwestern.edu)


2.) A survey has been posted under Documents on Blackboard. It shouldn't hopefully take more than a few minutes. And responses are anonymous and appreciated!

See you tomorrow,

Karthik
