Hey ISRCers,

 

Tonight Medill Grad Student Farah Chaudhry will be joining with us at ISRC ! First, we will watch a short documentary, which Farah was a production manager on. The film is about success stories in an area that was heavily impacted by the 1980s famine in Ethiopia. Then, Farah will discuss about Media in Africa and her experiences.


Farah is a McCormick scholar from Medill pursuing Masters in Media Strategy (and it's her last quarter of Grad School). She is from Nairobi, Kenya and is a co-founder of A24 Media, the first pan-African television syndication service. Farah is experienced as an executive producer of international documentaries, hard-news reporting and international business management.


The fireside will begin at 8PM in the main lounge. So, definitely come and take advantage of this wonderful opportunity ! 


See you all there,

Arkar
