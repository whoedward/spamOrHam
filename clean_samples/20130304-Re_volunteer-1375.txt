I know both Kate and Christina already volunteered, but I'd be interested too if needed.

    I would also be willing to do it. I've had to focus lights up there for shows before.

        Any spelunkers out there?  I need a volunteer who would like to crawl in the catwalk and help focus stage lights later this week.  Please do not volunteer id you donâ€™t like small spaces. 

        Re-focusing the lights is something we will need to do from time to time- so if you volunteer you will have access to extra hours now and in the future.
