Hi,

I am Ethan Robison with the McCormick Student Advisory Board (MSAB),and we're looking to get in touch with engineering student groups to help improve communication/collaboration among McCormick students.

I was given this email by William Worden (NU grad and a former coworker of mine) who told me that I could get in touch with you as the de facto captain.

With that in mind, please let me know if you are interested in interacting with MSAB. We have a lot of initiatives in place to help student groups and McCormick community members. This includes everything from a publicized calendar to standardized funding models, and a lot of other great resources.

I look forward to hearing more from you.

Best,
--
