Hello,

I'm not going to be able to make the meeting because I'll be flying back from New York.

I need my Friday 10am-2pm during finals week covered.

Tuesday I work until 4pm and can take any shift after that.
Wednesday I can take any shift 6pm or later.
Thursday I can take any shift.
Please don't give me all of the 30 hours I just said I was available. 

Thanks and happy reading week (or reading two days or whatever),

Will
