Hey Remotely Athletic Residents of ISRC!

I heard back on the initial schedules for IM. Remember even if you didn't sign up originally you can still join. IM sports are really fun and not a huge commitment. Send me an owl if you want to play any of the sports. The game times are as follows:

Flag Football - Sundays at 1 pm at Long Fields

If you aren't too serious, this is a lot of fun. We'll be on a team with Shepard this season.

Dodgeball - Mondays at 8 pm at Patton Gym

I have no idea what this is like, but its dodgeball, so how could it not be fun? We are on a team with PARC.

Volleyball - Sundays at 4 pm at Somewhere I don't know

This is my worst sport, but that just means we need more of you to help out. We are with PARC again. Woo!

Remember we want everyone to sign up, because its super fun, but due to the intricacies of IM Rules, if you lack a Y chromosome, we might want you a little more. And if you had the stamina to sludge through this email, remember there is a small chance it might transfer to athletics as well.

Send me any questions you have

Jonas
