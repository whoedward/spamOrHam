Hello Fellow Techs,

This is a reminder to everyone that we all must respond to every shift coverage-/swap-related email until it gets fulfilled (or cancelled). This includes shifts that one cannot cover.
Again, we have to respond to all of these emails, even if we cannot take the shifts. If we can take the shifts, or parts thereof, we most certainly should step up and cover them.

Best,
Ethan
