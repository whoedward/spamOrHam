Hey Nelson,

Just to let you know (you might know already) that permananent shift drops are a little different from coverages: people do not have to respond to them (although they really should). If you need them covered for any reason and cannot wait until the meeting, send out a shift coverage request for the relevant date. If you just want your shift taken because you no longer want it, we'll be certain to bring it up at the meeting.

If you have any question feel free to email ntssupervisors@gmail.com and we'll get back to you asap.

Regards,
Ethan

    Hey NTS!

    I have two shifts that I would like to give away permanently.

    1. Sunday 6-8pm
    2. Monday 10am-12pm

    These two shifts are usually pretty chill so grab them quick!

    Thanks!
    Nelson
