Hey everyone,

I will stop accepting petitions at 9pm today, so if you'd like to run for an exec position, you have until then to slide them under my door. Currently, we have no one running for secretary or tech chair, so if you are thinking of running, I recommend you think about these 2 positions.

I will be e-mailing candidates the electoral procedures some time tomorrow.

Thanks!
Thomas
