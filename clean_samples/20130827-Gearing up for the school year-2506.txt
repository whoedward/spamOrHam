Hey everybody,

Hope your summers have been great. Starting September 16th Norris will be returning to regular hours and we wanted to get a schedule together as soon as possible. 

For those of you who will be around next week, we will be having an ALL-STAFF MEETING TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3RD AT 4PM. Location is TBA but we'll let you know as soon as the date gets closer. 

If you won't be in town yet, or will be unable to make the meeting for whatever reason, please respond to this email with a quick explanation. We'll send out minutes afterword to keep everyone in the loop.

Thanks and enjoy the rest of summer,
Bobby Ramirez
