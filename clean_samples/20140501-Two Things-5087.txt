Techs,

Two things:
First thing, the projector in Alumni Room has been fit with a new ceiling frame. This frame is very sensitive to being pushed out of position, so please don't try to turn the projector in Alumni on by pressing the power button on the projector, but rather, use the remote.

Secondly, all smart rooms and rooms with cabinets now have laminated pieces of paper inside their respective stack/cabinet that say "Troubleshooting Guide" on them. This is because they are troubleshooting guides. If something isn't working in a room, I would wager that a good majority of the problems can be solved by following the steps on the guides. I hope this makes everyone's job a little easier.
