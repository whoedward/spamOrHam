ARTIST RECASTS LEGACIES OF JIMI HENDRIX AND OTHER HISTORICAL FIGURES

EVANSTON, Ill. --- For more than 30 years, artist and musician Terry Adkins has paid tribute to unheralded and underappreciated individuals through installation-based experiences called “recitals” that mean to restore honorees to their rightful place in the annals of history and illuminate lesser-known aspects of their biographies. 

“Terry Adkins Recital,” the Winter 2013 main gallery exhibition at Northwestern University’s Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Jan. 11 to March 24, brings together sculpture, photography and video works by the artist. An opening reception will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 12, at the museum, which is located at 40 Arts Circle Drive, on the University’s Evanston campus.

• Saturday, Jan. 12 -- Adkins will take part in a 3 p.m. conversation at the Block Museum about his work with artists Theaster Gates and Dawoud Bey; Renaissance Society associate curator Hamza Walker; Huey Copeland, associate professor of art history at Northwestern; and Ian Berry, Dayton Director of The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College. The conversation is preceded by a 2 p.m. opening reception. The program is free and open to the public. It will also be webcast live.
