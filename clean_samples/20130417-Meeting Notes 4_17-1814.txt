Hi NTS,

Here are the notes from tonight's meeting.

Annoucements

Starting immediately, if there is an out-of-house event that has not been covered, it is the responsibility of the tech on shift to cover it. This means there will only be one tech running Norris events. We will make every effort to get the out-of-house event covered by someone else, but if nobody can do it, then the shift techs must run that event.

We have new laptops, 4 Dells and 2 Macs. The Macs can dualboot into Windows.

Notes:  The username is ".\Norris.Tech" instead of Norris.Tech.  The password remains the same, which is "We.are.N0rr15!!$$"

To boot the Macs into windows - You hold down the ALT key as you power on the machine.  A screen with 3 drives will pop up.  Select windows and hit enter.

To get back to Mac OSX turn off the machine and turn it back on.

Thanks to everyone who took a Ryan/Out of house event tonight. I know that it's sometimes frustrating when there's a bajillion events that need to be covered and everyone's busy with other things, but we really appreciate it.

Have a nice week!

Alex
