Join us in Hinman Dining Hall for dinner with
 
Professor Lynne Kiesling
at 6 PM on Wednesday, March 13th
 
If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to be an Econ major
or work in an Environmental field, this is for you!
Even if not, casual conversation with/getting to know an esteemed faculty member is always good! :)
Prof. Kiesling is relevant, dynamic, and engaging, so it's sure to be a fun time!
She will answer any questions you have about academics, too, so see you there!
