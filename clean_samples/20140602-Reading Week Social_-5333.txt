Hi everyone,
 
So reading week (for Weinberg students at least) is this week and finals are coming up.  I’m wondering if people are up for a board game social sometime this week!  The belt test is also coming up on Wednesday, so if we were to have one, we’d probably aim for after the belt test.
 
My question then is whether or not people are interested, and what days would work best.
 
Doodle poll for days is below, times we can figure out after we decide on a day.
