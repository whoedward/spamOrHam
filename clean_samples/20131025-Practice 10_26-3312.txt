Hey, guys,

I just wanted to remind you all that there IS practice tomorrow Saturday from noon to 2 P.M. at Blom. For those who want to practice sparring, bring sparring gear. And if there is anything that you guys want to work on, just let me or any of the officers know. Thanks, and I hope to see you guys tomorrow.

Yours truly,
Davin
