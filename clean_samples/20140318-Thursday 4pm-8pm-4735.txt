Hey everyone,

I don't want to spam the listserv, but we don't have a meeting this week so I thought I'd send out an email.

Would anybody be able to take my 4pm - 8pm shifts this Thursday?  I've got tickets for a 7:30pm show downtown.  I could potentially still make it if I worked the 4-6pm, but it'd be easier for me if both the shifts got covered. 
The 6pm-8pm is higher priority though.

I've released both shifts on shiftplanning.  Many thanks!

Ryan
