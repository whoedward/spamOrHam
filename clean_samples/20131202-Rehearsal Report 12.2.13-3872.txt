Rehearsal Notes:

    We’re back! We had a very productive day, and were able to run through the entirety of Shakespeare’s Act 1 several times. The actors were able to play and work with a lot of things, and we found a lot that was new and fun.
    We have so many people either missing or conflicting for part of rehearsal tomorrow that we’re actually going to cancel, and push things back a day. So our run-thru of Act I (technically Acts 1, 2 & 3) is now going to be this Saturday.

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Props/Blood Notes:

    Retractable knives! Would it be possible to get 6 of them? That’s how many people use them to stab Caesar. Let us know!

Costume Notes:

    None today!

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Everyone go to Jamba Juice tomorrow, and say “Julius Caesar” at the register when you pay for your drink/sandwich/whathaveyou. Here’s the link to the Facebook event, if anyone wants more info! https://www.facebook.com/events/589904694398125/
