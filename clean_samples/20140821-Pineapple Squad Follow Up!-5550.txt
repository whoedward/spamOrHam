Hey everyone!

You just got an invitation to join the awesome ISRC fantasy football league. Please play if you enjoy or think you might enjoy it, or even if you just want to try to win by pure dumb luck! (I did it last year. Dreams can happen).

Don't worry about the draft time, its just a placeholder. So if you want to play, just sign up, and then we can get this sweet thing going! 

Hope your summer is going good! Collectively!

-Eric
