Hi All,

I would like to say that first of all, it has been an honor to be your Fellows Chair for this past year. It has been an amazing experience, and certainly, it would not have been the same without you. Thus, it is my deepest hope that you will join us at this, my last fellows social. It will be held on Thursday, March 13th, at noon in Hinman Dining Hall. Have lunch there with the fellows, and then join us in the ISRC Main Lounge for pastries and drinks.

I will also need assistance buying a few items on Wednesday night. Meet in the ISRC Main Lounge at 6:45PM and come with me to Whole Foods for a service point.

This will be the last fellows social of the quarter and of my tenure, so no effort has been spared to make this the best one yet. I hope that you have had fun this year, and that you will be there on Thursday.

Cheers,
Chang
