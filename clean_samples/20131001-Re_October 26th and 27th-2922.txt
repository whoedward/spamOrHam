        Hey All,

        I realize that it's a long way away, but I know how Saturdays can be. I am scheduled for work on Saturday the 26th from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m.

        I would like to be able to make it home for my Mother's surprise birthday party. So, even though I might not have these shifts (I probably will), I would like to get them covered as early as possible. With that said...

        Who wants 'em?

        Best,
        Ethan
