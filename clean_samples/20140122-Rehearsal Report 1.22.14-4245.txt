Rehearsal Notes:

    After our warm-up, we were able to work through some scenes that had started to feel a little stale, and were able to find something new with all of them, which was great. Since we spent so much time working, we then compressed our run through into the last hour and 15 minutes of rehearsal.
    We did a speed run, which was awesome to see. The energy was fantastic, and the actors worked very quickly but also thoughtfully. There were very few breaks in focus. Maia and I feel like we’re both in a comfortable pre-tech place with the show, which is great.

Scenery Notes:

    How is furniture going? Will we have a chair/tables/bench?

Prop Notes:

    Thank you for the email!

Costume Notes:

    Emily will be wearing the same bloody bandage that she has on her head when she is carried across the stage in the end of the show, when she is in scene 5.5 with Brutus.  

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    See you tomorrow!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Thanks for your continued hard work!
