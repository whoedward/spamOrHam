Thanks, Mom!
We went and looked at the apartment today; it looks awesome and we're all excited for it.

Dad tells you everything anyway. I might have texted you were it not for the fact that I was already texting Dad. Next time I will text you both.

Love,
Ethan

    Ethan,

    I email Teresa my paystub yesterday.  She thanked me for my promptness.  I also filled out the application on line.  Also, the check went out in today’s mail and should be there soon. 

     

    Did you check on your “finals package?”

     

    Love,

    Mom

     

    PS  I heard you applied to a secret place.  I guess it was so secret you couldn’t tell your mom – just your dad.
