Welcome back to Spring Quarter, NTS!

Our first meeting of the quarter will be Wednesday at 7PM, room TBA. 
Since it is the first meeting of the quarter, please think about the shifts that you want to give up permanently, and per usual, the shifts that you only need covered temporarily. Release shifts on shiftplanning. 

If you cannot attend the meeting, email your reason to ntssupervisors@gmail.com

Thanks,
Will
