Hi everyone,

Hope you've all had a good start to the quarter!

Campus Kitchens is hosting a Hunger Games tournament this Saturday April 12, 2-4PM in Sargent, in collaboration with AEPi, Delt, and DZ. We're looking for teams of 5-6 people to participate in the events, which will include PB&J sandwich-making, a relay race, and trivia questions. 

This is a good opportunity to have fun with friends while supporting a great cause!

Please email arleenli2016@u.northwestern.edu or sandeepjain2014@u.northwestern.edu to register your team. Alternatively, you can register through the following Google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zHNjlV_seH_GVTIY5htl9Z-s9N6QtDnC4vJcfWFYqAg/viewform

You can also find the Facebook event here. Please let us know if you have any questions!

Best,
Campus Kitchens at Northwestern University
