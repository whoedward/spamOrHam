Hi Ethan, you can make up the lab next week.  I no longer have your schedule on hand, but would it be possible for you to come at 11:15, since there are only 3 people in that section?  If not, we can accommodate you into another time, just please let me know.

Thanks,

Erica

    Hi Erica,

    I absolutely forgot. I apologize for the oversight on my part, but I was under some sort of impression that I had a lab scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon as opposed to 1:15 p.m. Is there any way in which I can make up the lab next week when the second group runs its trials?

    Best,
    Ethan Robison

        Hi Ethan,

        Are you still enrolled in Chem Eng 321?  You were scheduled for lab at 1:15 this afternoon, and you have not yet shown up, so I wanted to check to see if you maybe just forgot.

        Thanks,

        Erica McCready
