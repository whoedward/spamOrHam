To all Norris Center student staff:

As a part of your position with the Norris University Center you are required to complete a pre-year and year-end survey. These tools are required and are not judgments or analyses of your individual abilities, assets, or accomplishments. It is our way to view the potential for learning to occur over the course of a year while being a student staff member of the Norris Center.

Please use the included link to complete the Norris Pre-Year Survey for the 2012-2013 academic year.

Completion of this assessment before November 23, 2012 is mandatory. You will not receive your quarterly raise if you do not complete the assessment and your professional staff supervisor will be notified of your failure to complete this tool.

Thank you in advance for finishing this survey in a timely fashion. It should take you no longer than ten minutes; the average time in the past has been closer to five minutes.
