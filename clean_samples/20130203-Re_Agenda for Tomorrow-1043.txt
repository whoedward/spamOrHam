Okay guys, I just received a very last minute email about our education session today at my fraternity... Apparently we're doing it at 3 instead of our normal 7:30 because of the superbowl. Since we apparently have a rather light meeting today would it be alright for me to miss? I'll save the pop and granola bars for Tue don't worry ;).

    It is pretty last minute to cancel; we can show up. There isn't really anything we couldn't do when we're already going to meet on Tue, but at least we'll make that one shorter.

        I wouldn't be averse meeting just to talk about the homework, web assign thing, and reading

        That being said, scheduling shop times, even if not for tomorrow, for later this week would still be a good idea
