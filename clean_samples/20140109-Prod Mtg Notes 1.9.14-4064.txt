General Notes:

·      If you have not done so yet, please send your designs to Olivia Probetts!

·      Build starts this weekend and haven’t signed up for a shift, please do so! We’re asking that you put in 2 hours each weekend.

·      Next week is a big publicity week!

·      Banner will be painted next week on the 18th

Set Notes:

    We’ll not be renting scaffolding, but building it
    Build schedule for each weekend will be roughly as follows

·  First weekend: goal for jersey barriers close to finished by end of Sunday

·  Second weekend: archway (will probably not take whole weekend (possibly look into using Joe’s arch that was build for Urinetown)

·  Third weekend: hexagonal platforms should take a day or less, misc. touchup

·                 Chicken wire/paper mache for sides of platforms

Prop Notes:

    Guns, barbed wire, flashlights all on the way
    Sigil ideas are all in place, still working on getting
    Flag will be draped over body bag

Costume Notes:

    Once the costumes have final approval
    We will be doing a couple blood runs before tech week; it would be very helpful

Light Notes:

    There will be enough cable
    Issues that need to be resolved: boom cannot be in egress aisle
    There will also most likely be booms backstage

Sound Notes:

    Still need to record cheering cue
    Would like to come to rehearsal one day
    Speakers being acquired from Arts Alliance
    Need to go over how much “war” sound will need to be in scenes 4.1 and 4.2
    Still need Karl’s pedal for reverb mic!

Publicity Notes:

    Merch is on the way
    Final poster is done

Fundraising Notes:

    We got $1800 in checks from fundraising letters!
    Bake sale is tomorrow
    Everyone should share the Indiegogo!

Outreach Notes:

    High schools have organized a field trip, definitely for Thursday!
    Would like to do a talk back Thursday night after the show.

Blood Notes:

    Generally best idea is to have two sets of each thing
    Stabbing knife mechanism: bulb or bag
    Easiest thing for pool of blood—attach blood bag to Caesar, we will definitely be able to work on this
    Most testing will be done January 17th
    Water run would be a good idea!
