Thanks; we are going to try and get two extra techs on the 4-6 shift, so there can be one for Block and one for Great Room and two here.  We'll see who responds and what we can do.

        Hey guys,

        On the new AV Board there are two equipment deliveries on Wednesday.

        1) Deliver small pwrd speaker & stand to Block Museum at 4:30; clean up 8:30
        2) Deliver prjctr screen & prjctr to Great Room at 5; clean up 8

        Can anyone do setups?  I have class that whole time.  I figure that we can just recruit people after the meeting for cleanups.
