    Their keynote speaker is opening the day in McCormick, then they break out to other rooms at 845am.  So that probably means one tech dedicated to McCormick and two setting rooms.

    I am on that shift. If we're coming in at 7:30 and we're both there on time, it should be okay. If this is an event loaded with high-rollers, though, we should get another tech onboard.

        I would think two people can set that in an hour's time, but we can certainly try to get someone else on that if you want. Ethan, isn't that your shift? What do you think?
