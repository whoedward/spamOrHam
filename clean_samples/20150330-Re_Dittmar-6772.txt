Hello,

I asked Phoebe and Magan,  who were on shift Friday, and they said there were no sheets and they didn't go in Dittmar for any reason that day. Was there a setup in the gallery on another day that week perhaps? I couldn't find anything on our sheets.  None of us supers were there last week so we are not sure.

Please let us know how else we can help.
