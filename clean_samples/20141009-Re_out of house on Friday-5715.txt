I can't take the Saturday event; I'm going to be out of town.

    There is an out of house of Friday and an extra tech shift on Saturday that have not been filled yet.  Can we make sure they are covered ASAP.  The Friday shift wasnâ€™t on the Av board because the details were not entered into EMS because the client was slow to respond yesterday.

     

    Thanks,
