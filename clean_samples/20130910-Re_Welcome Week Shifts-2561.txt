I was just about to send that info over to Pete right now. Go for it though. The Ryan events don't call for any equipment from Norris so they can just meet us there as long as we explain getting the Ryan key from the info desk. 

And, yup, meeting is the 20th at 7pm. Should be a Friday.

    Hey Supers!

    Just a quick note before we have all sorts of exciting fun for tomorrow (this will be us):  there appears to be four open shifts left for Welcome Week.  They are highlighted in red.  If you see any you want, go get them!

    Also I can email Pete Dully about scheduling for Ryan.  I figure it will be easiest to meet his staff over at Ryan and then they can work together there.  Our NTS meeting for scheduling is Sept. 20 at 7; is that correct or am I forgetting?

    See you all tomorrow morning!
