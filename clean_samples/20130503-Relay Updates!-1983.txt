Hello ISRC!
 
I have Relay for Life updates for you all!
 
First, check out this awesome picture of one of the coolest parts about Relay for Life, the luminarias that are lit to celebrate anyone who has ever fought cancer:
 
 
Secondly, please join my doodle poll to go canning in downtown Evanston this Sunday to raise money for Relay for Life.   You don't have to be on the team to go canning, and you get a philanthropy point (which you can't really you for anything, but it's fun to get points, so why not?!!)  There are half-hour shifts from 12-2:30.  Here's the link:

Finally, don't just stop with canning - please join the ISRC Relay for Life team if you haven't already, and do so by next Friday, because the event is Friday, May 17!  All you have to do is follow the instructions below, donate $10 to yourself, and raise $40 more.
 
 
1. Google Northwestern Relay for Life, or follow this link. http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/RFLCY13IL?pg=entry&fr_id=48490
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Click "Join an existing team"
4. Type the name "Team Leena", or, if that doesn't work, try "Team ISRC"
5. There will be a $10 registration fee, which I recommend paying immediately by credit card.
6. The suggested fundraising goal is $100, but you really only need to raise $50. And the $10 fee goes toward that goal.
7. Click next, etc., you can figure a bunch of it out for yourselves.
8. Follow different instructions depending on whether you're a new or returning participant.
9. After completing your registration, it would be smart to immediately look under My Tools, then under Send a Message, and click "Ask for a Donation". You'll be given a pre-written message, but you can personalize it and email it to a couple relatives/friends, and there will be a link at the bottom where people can donate, and you'll probably reach your goal just doing that!
 
Thank you all!!!!
