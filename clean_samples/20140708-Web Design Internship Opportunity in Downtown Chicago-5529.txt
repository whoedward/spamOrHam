Hi everyone!
The company for which I am working this summer is looking for someone to redesign their current website, starting as soon as possible. I have attached the position description below. It is a Trading firm located in the loop downtown. Feel free to email me any questions, and I encourage anyone interested to contact Frank Congine (his email is in the attachment).
