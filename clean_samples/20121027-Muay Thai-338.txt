Hey guys,

Muay Thai is tomorrow from 10am-12pm as usual in SPAC. Some of you guys might be going to jiu jitsu so we'll try and wrap it up a bit earlier.

From here on out, we'll be drilling combos, defense work, movement and conditioning. We've covered all the basics, so now it's time to refine our skills.

Remember to bring dues, $20 for one martial art, $25 for more.

Also, starting next week through the rest of the quarter, Muay Thai will be from 1-3pm. Same location in SPAC. Hopefully this works better for some of you.

Ann
