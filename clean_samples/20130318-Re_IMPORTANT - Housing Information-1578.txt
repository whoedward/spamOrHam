Hello Hannah,

I was looking over the list for Winter quarter, and I do not seem to have sufficient points to be on any of the lists. I am not entirely certain whether or not I should be on any of them, but it is possible that I participated enough. Is there anything that I can do to ensure that I will be eligible to return to ISRC next year, despite a dearth of points?

Thanks,
Ethan

    Hey everyone, 

    You should have received an e-mail from the Undergraduate Housing Office today. The "Returning Student Housing Application Procedure" is only if you wish to enter the housing lottery for residence halls, not residential colleges, sorority/fraternity houses, or other exclusive-use buildings.  Entering the housing lottery automatically forfeits you from every other housing process. 

    If you plan to live in ISRC next year, please follow the instructions below. 

    1. Make sure you earned enough points to be on 3rd list in both fall and winter quarters (http://bit.ly/UEzfy4 and http://bit.ly/Sxa2BT). If you are missing points, and you have not already talked to me, you must do so ASAP. I can't help you after the quarter is over. 

    2. Print and fill out the Letter of Intent (attached) and return it to me by 12 p.m. (noon) on Friday, April 5th. You can give it to me in person, or slide it under my door, room 309. The housing office will not accept residents without this form. 

    3. E-mail me by 11:59 p.m. on Monday, April 8th with: 
    a) the name of your roommate (if you plan to have one)
    b) your top three room preferences for next year (http://groups.northwestern.edu/isrc/floorplan.html)

    As always, if you have any questions about any part of the housing process (ISRC or otherwise), feel free to ask! 

    Hope you all have a wonderful spring break. :) 

    Hannah
