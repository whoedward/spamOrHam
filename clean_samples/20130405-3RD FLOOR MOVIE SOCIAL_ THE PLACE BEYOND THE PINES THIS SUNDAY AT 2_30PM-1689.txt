Hi guys,

Welcome back for the last stretch of the year! I hope your first week is going well. For our first social of the quarter, I was hoping to go watch "The Place Beyond the Pines" starring Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper this sunday, April 7th at 2:30PM at Century 12 in Evanston. Lets plan to meet outside my room at 2:15PM and walk over as a group. I will be subsidizing this event so please reply to this E-mail if you plan on coming so that I know how many people to expect. Have a great weekend!

Best,
Danny
