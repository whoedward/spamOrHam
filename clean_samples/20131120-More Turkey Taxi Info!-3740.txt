Hello, lovely ISRCers!

Sorry to flood your inboxes, but this is important. I just learned more details about the Jewel Osco shopping trip this Sunday that's part of Turkey Taxi. The 1-2 ISRC shoppers will be in group 2; see below. (Transportation is provided, in case that wasn't clear.)

Group 2: Meet at the roundabout in front of Scott Hall at 9:55 am, leave for Jewel Osco at 10:00 am
