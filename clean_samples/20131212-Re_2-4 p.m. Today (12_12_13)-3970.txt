Hey Ethan,

Yeah! I got caught up in the whirlwind of finals week and I forgot, but as soon as I saw your email I sprinted over. Fortunately, there weren't any events during our shift, but I got there in time to stay for most of it.

    Hey guys,

    There seems to have been a bit of confusion regarding the 2-4 shift today (12/12).
    Juan, you were supposed to cover Will's shift.
    Alex, you informed me that you had to catch a different shuttle to get to work.
    Please email me or ntssupervisors@gmail.com to help clear up the issue.

    Regards,
    Ethan
