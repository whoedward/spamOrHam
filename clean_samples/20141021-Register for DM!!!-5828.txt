Hello ISRC!

This is the only week that Dance Marathon registration is open! Go to 
http://www.nudm.org/ 
and register! If you join the ISRC team, our fundraising events (like Penny Wars) will help you complete your fundraising goal! 

There will be a DM info session at 7pm tonight in Leverone Auditorium (in Kellogg). This is a great way to gain more knowledge about the registration process and the event itself if you are still trying to decide whether or not to participate.

Let me know if you have any questions! 

ISRClove,
Ellen
