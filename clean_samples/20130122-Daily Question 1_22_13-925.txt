Hello Professor,

I am emailing you in regards to today's daily question. I attempted the problem to the best of my ability, and came up with 1.6 (8/5); however, Blackboard returned this answer as incorrect. Wolfram Alpha, when used with the method demonstrated in the solutions to last week's daily questions, also yielded 1.6. If this is a mistake on my part, could you please take a few moments tomorrow morning to review how one would go about doing the question?

Thank you,
Ethan Robison
