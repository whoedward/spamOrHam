Hi ISRCers!

The Office of Residential Academic Initiatives (ORAI) will be conducting a series of student-faculty events to help students plan for winter course registration. Now in its second year, "Coming Soon to a Classroom Near You" is a great way for students to learn more about upcoming courses before registering for winter quarter. Faculty members and advisers are coming into residential settings to connect informally with students. 

These events are great opportunities for students to meet new faculty members, learn about majors and special programs, and make informed decisions for next quarter. Join one or more events on Facebook or e-mail ResAcademicInitiatives@northwestern.edu so we know you're coming. We're not worried about running out of good conversation, but we don't want to run out of great food.

A number of the courses being represented align with ISRC's theme. Also, Sunday's event is a free brunch in ISRC's dining hall. Can't beat that!

 

*Here are links for events in the week ahead, the first of which is for this Sunday:
