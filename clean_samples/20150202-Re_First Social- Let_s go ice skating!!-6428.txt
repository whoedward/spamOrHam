    Hi all,
    So, our first social is coming up!! It'll be a more chill social, we'll be ice skating at MAGGIE DALEY PARK (woop)- please meet at 1:30 in the Main Lounge on Saturday, 2/7 so we can go over to Norris to rent skates and then head on down to the park.
    Since the debit card is still in the works, there won't be any food (sorry) so please eat beforehand; if the Paul funds free up there may or may not be snacks. But all are free to come! E-mail me if you are interested in joining us! You'll have to cover transportation but it is otherwise FREE

    Here is Maggie Daley Park:


    and here is a red panda


    See y'all Saturday,
    Paul
