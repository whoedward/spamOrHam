Hi ISRC,

If you bought a ticket to the RCB formal and can no longer attend, please notify me IMMEDIATELY. I need a finalized roster for attendance. And if you give your ticket to someone else, I need the new person's name.

Be on the look out for another email tonight with more details about the formal itself. 

Thank you!

Best,
Esteban
