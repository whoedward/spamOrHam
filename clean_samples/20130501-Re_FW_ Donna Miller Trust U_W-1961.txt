    Hello Leslie,

    As per our telephone conversation, attached are the letters that need signed and returned to us as soon as possible.  We are not able to list the property until we have ALL of the signed letters.  Please scan the signed letters to me and also mail the originals to my attention at Somerset Trust Company, 1416 Scalp Avenue, Johnstown, PA  15904.  If faxing is better for you, please fax to 814-266-5300.
