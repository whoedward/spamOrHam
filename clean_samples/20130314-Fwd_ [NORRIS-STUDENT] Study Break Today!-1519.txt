C'mon guys, come and take a load off (plus we have been seriously lacking in department representation since the beginning of the year...)!

AND IT'S FREE.  AS IN FREE FOOD AND SPECIAL TREATMENT.  So come!

...And that about does it for my enthusiasm for the entire rest of the week.  Happy studying.  -.-

It's here! Head down to the Game Room between 4-6 this afternoon for free games, pizza, snacks, and desserts! There will be massage chairs. And playdoh. And all your favorite Norris employees! Sign in and receive points for your department! See you there!
