Hi Ethan!

From College Gameday to Fall Blowout to the great weather, it’s been a pretty unforgettable quarter here at Northwestern. Don’t just leave it at one great quarter, though – make the rest of your time here at NU just as amazing!

Have you always wanted more lighting off campus? How about grant programs? Your own personal robot to serve you coffee in the library at 2 AM?

Now is your chance to tell the administration what you want!

The Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee (UBPC) wants your ideas on how to improve undergraduate life. Let us know your suggestions by filling out the Campus Brainstorm here. 

Thanks and Go ‘Cats!

The UBPC
