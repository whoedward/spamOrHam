Hey you!,

So lovely residents in combination with the amazing exec board made a banner for us for the homecoming parade tomorrow night at 6. It's not a huge walk down Sheridan and we would love for you to join us and show your pride for NU and ISRC! 

Right afterwards is a free screening of Despicable Me 2 in Norris by A&O Productions! So we can all make a trek to the parade and then relax in Norris with a lovely movie. So we'll be meeting in the lobby of ISRC for the parade at 5:45 and head to Norris right after. If you just want to see the movie, you can just meet us at Norris and we'll save you a seat!

Can't wait to hang with you guys and BTHO Ohio St.!,
Sorry, my hometown just came out,
Hali
