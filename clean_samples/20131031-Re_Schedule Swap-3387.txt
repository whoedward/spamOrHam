Hey,

As an addendum to that, I will not be able to take that shift this weekend, so that would take effect starting on the 9th.

    Hey Ethan,

    Sorry I didn't get in touch with you right away about this, but Alex told me you'd be willing to pass off your Saturday 10-2 shift? If you're still down to do that, I would be really grateful. Let me know!

    Thanks,
    Jake Degler
