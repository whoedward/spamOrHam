    - General Question/Note

    Question, Suggestion, or Note
    	

    Last week (writing this 4/21/15), whoever was working Continuing Ed failed to clean up once the class ended. All equipment was left on the stage, the McCormick booth was left unlocked and lit up, and things were generally disorganized. This was about an hour and a half following the conclusion of the class.

    Perhaps I'm biased having working Continuing Ed all last quarter, and I hate to to have rip on the work of a fellow NTS member, but I was really, really unimpressed. It shouldn't be the job of In-House to take care of Extra Tech's responsibilities.
