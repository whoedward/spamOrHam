Hey, ISRC! 

Join the ASG Sustainability Committee in Northwestern's first ever Environmental Day of Service! Volunteer at seven sites across Evanston and campus doing things like preserving prairies, gardening, mulching and cleaning up litter. 

The event is on Saturday, November 15th from 9 a.m. to noon, and includes a free breakfast and t-shirt for all participants. And you'll earn Green Cup points for your residence hall, fraternity, sorority or off-campus group for attending! 

Sign-ups are now live at bit.ly/EnvironmentalDayofService and will close on November 1st. You can also RSVP to the Facebook event here. 

If you have any questions, email asg-sustainability@u.northwestern.edu. 

Thank you!
