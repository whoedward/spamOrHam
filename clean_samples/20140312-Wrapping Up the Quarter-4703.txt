Hey, guys,

First off, congratulations to all who tested today and thanks to all those who helped out. Looking forward to training with you guys again next quarter~

As Andrew announced earlier, we will be having a little hangout at Ji-hoon's apartment (1930 Ridge Ave., Apt C307) from 5 - 8 P.M. on Saturday. Feel free to bring some food and boardgames to play.

If you are still interested in performing with us for the KASA Show, please let me know and come to practice this Saturday.

Lastly, even though our official practices are over for the quarter, the floor space will still be available throughout finals week during our regular practice times (Blomquist will close at 9 P.M. though), and I plan on being there. Feel free to come out and de-stress a little bit.

Good luck with the end of this quarter, thanks for all your support, and safe travels to those who will be going out of town.

Yours,
Davin
