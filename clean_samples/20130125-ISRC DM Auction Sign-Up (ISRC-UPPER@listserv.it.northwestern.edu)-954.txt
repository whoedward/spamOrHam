I've shared an item with you.

Hello everyone!

Here is a Google Doc where you can sign up for ISRC's DM auction.  Instructions are included at the top of the document.

If you'd previously signed up with me via e-mail, I already started an entry for you.  However, you will have to go in and fill in the missing information.  Feel free to change anything else about your entry as well.

Some of you had a couple ideas about what to auction off, but hadn't yet decided on one.  For those people, I put all of your ideas in one entry.  If you've since decided which one you want to do, feel free to delete the other options.  If you would like to auction off more than one thing, please do!  Just split each thing into a separate entry.

Thanks to everyone who has volunteered so far.  And if you haven't yet volunteered, please really get thinking about what you'd like to auction off.  We'd like at least three people from each suite to participate in this (and exec members don't count).  People who are doing Dance Marathon should especially participate.

As always, let me know if you have any questions!

Sincerely,

Emily

ISRC DM Auction Sign-Up

Instructions:  Please copy the following template, paste it to the bottom of the document, and fill in the information.  For “description,” include a brief explanation/elaboration if the item you are auctioning off is not self-explanatory, or if you feel more details are needed.   For Northwestern/Evanston/ISRC only, indicate whether the thing you’re auctioning off is limited to a certain place.  (For example, if you’re giving a music lesson, you probably want to limit it to Evanston, because you won’t be able to travel far away for the lesson.  If, on the other hand, you are offering to make something that can be mailed, geography isn’t an issue.)  If the thing you’re auctioning off is not distance-dependent, answer “no” to that question.

Auctioning off:  Counted cross stitch lesson

Description:  In the lesson, I will teach the basics of counted cross stitch.  I will do this by guiding the highest bidder in stitching a simple sampler of their choice (or at least providing instruction until they get the hang of it and can finish it themselves).  The highest bidder will choose the sampler that we work on.  Some good possibilities can be found at this website:  http://everythingcrossstitch.com/cross-stitch-kit-baby-and-little-kids-mrl-c218.aspx?pagenum=1  The samplers are not limited to that website; if the bidder can find another sampler they would rather do, that is fine.  If they want me to guide them through the completion of the sampler, however, it needs to be a very small, simple beginner’s sampler, like many of the ones at the link.  The length/number of sessions depends on how quickly we make progress, but I am willing to keep working with the bidder until they are satisfied with what they’ve learned.

Suggested starting bid (optional):

Northwestern/Evanston/ISRC only?:  ISRC residents only

Name:  Emily Kaht

Room number:  203

Auctioning off:  One of each Pottermore potion currently available.

Description:  Pottermore is a website created by J.K. Rowling that allows users to explore moments from the Harry Potter books.  Among other things, it contains extra information from J.K. Rowling about the Harry Potter world that did not fit into the books.  The site is interactive, with one of the available activities being brewing potions.  Sometimes this is just for fun or to earn points; however, in some cases, the user needs to have possession of a certain potion in order to access a certain part of the site.  If you don’t want to make the potion yourself, you can have it gifted to you by someone else.  So, the winner of this auction will be gifted one of each of the following potions:  Antidote to Common Poisons, Cure for Boils, Forgetfulness Potion, Herbicide, Sleeping Draught, Swelling Solution, Wideye or Awakening Potion, Polyjuice Potion - Part 1, and Polyjuice Potion - Part 2.  The bidder must have or create a Pottermore account.

Suggested starting bid (optional):

Northwestern/Evanston/ISRC only?:  No.
