Hey NUSTARS!

For anyone who still wants to be involved but also had something keeping them from our information session last week, don't forget we'll be having another one! That information session is going to be Thursday, 8-9PM in LR3.


And below you'll find some updates for each team:


Microgravity Team
The Microgravity Team will be having a work session on Friday from 7-8:30PM. You don't need to bring anything but your wonderful selves either - we'll spend this session mostly getting you up to speed on our project.

"But what if I have a prior commitment or something similar on Friday? Can I still get caught up?" you ask?
BOY! Do I have good news for you!

If you can't make it Friday, the Microgravity Team also be meeting for 20-30 minutes after the Information Session on Thursday (so that would mean we're meeting at about 9PM) in LR3. But definitely try to come to the Friday one!


Rocketry Team
The Rocketry Team held its first meeting this Monday, so for anyone who is interested and missed it, I have the two main things you need to know! These meetings will be held every Monday at 8PM in Ford. So come along next week! And make sure to bring your laptop as well (assuming you own one). And if you get a chance, try to download and play around with simulations in Open Rocket (it's free!).

Can't wait to see you all!
Peace&Love,
Sam
