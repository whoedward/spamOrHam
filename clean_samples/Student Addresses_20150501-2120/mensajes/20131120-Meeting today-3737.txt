Hey guys,

Sorry about the late notice but something just came up and I can't make it to the meeting.

As far as my schedule goes, on Saturday I am free any time after 6 PM (so I can take a rotation) and I am also willing to work the Friday Rotation.

On sunday I am free after 4 pm. and on Monday I am free after 2 PM.
