Hello ISRC!

First I would like to say great job to all of you for your hard work with decorating the suites. Rohan and I walked around with the Master's Staff today, and were blown away by the creativity and dedication you all put into your suite. 

The Master's Staff voted andâ€¦(insert drumroll in your head)

1st Place- JAPAN!!!! 
The Master's Staff will be taking everyone in 2-Red to dinner at Todoroki (date tbd)

2nd Place- Ethiopia!! 
The Master's Staff will take everyone in 2-Blue to Addis Abeba for dinner (date tbd)

The Exec Board would also like to give a special shout out to China, Thailand and Spain. We thought you all did a great job as well! As Rohan said, "I like China and Thailand, and Spain is cool." China had the 3D bamboo, Thailand had the silhouette of Bangkok and Spain had the "Ladies of 3-Green."

Once again, everyone did a GREAT job. Hopefully you all got a chance to bond with your suite mates!! 

ISRCLove,
Esteban
