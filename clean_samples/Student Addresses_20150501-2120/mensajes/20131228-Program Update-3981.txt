Hey Michael,

I wanted to get in touch with you regarding the program. A couple of things to let you know:
1) The program is coming along in Visual Basic (read: ready to go).
2) There is the potential to develop Sharepoint applications. If you'd like, I can look into that.
3) It might be worth getting a computer to act as a "server" for a database or such. We can use any old computer, but a dedicated desktop would make things easier.

Hope you're having a good holiday,
Ethan
