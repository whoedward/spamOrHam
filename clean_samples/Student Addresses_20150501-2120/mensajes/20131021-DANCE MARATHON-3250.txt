Hello, lovely ISRCers,

Dance Marathon registration is today until this Friday the 25th! http://www.nudm.org/

Do DM with ISRC!!!! Do DM with ISRC!!!!!  http://www.nudm.org/

Before you protest...
1. I know it is hard to raise $400 by March 7
2. I know it is hard to dance for 30 hours nonstop from March 7-9
3. SOMETIMES THE HARDEST THINGS ARE THE MOST REWARDING!!!!!!  http://www.nudm.org/

The primary beneficiary is Team Joseph - Defeating Duchenne (a type of muscular dystrophy). 

I and the philanthropy committee will work our hardest from now until March 7 to raise money for the ISRC DM team and make your fundraising job as easy as possible.

Do DM and I'll love you forever! THANKS SO MUCH!

ISRClove,
Ayla
