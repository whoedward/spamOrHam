Hello all,
Thank you so much for everyone that signed up for IM this quarter. I received the finalized schedule for this quarter; we are starting THIS SUNDAY so get hyped

Our schedule is as follows:
Football: Sundays at 12 noon
Volleyball: Sundays at 3 PM
Dodgeball: Tuesdays at 7:30 PM

Two notes: Dodgeball starts NEXT Tuesday. We are paired with Chapin and Hobart for football.

We will meet at 11:15 AM this Sunday to go over some IM-specific rules (we are meeting this early because Long Field is a good walk and I want to warm up some). Similarly, we will meet at 2:30 in the main lounge for volleyball, and at 7 on Tuesday for dodgeball. Even if you didn't sign up you can come!! The more people the better (in theory). Also, for volleyball and dodgeball please bring your wildcards as we will likely have to sign into Blom.

If y'all want team names let me know.

Paul Kim
