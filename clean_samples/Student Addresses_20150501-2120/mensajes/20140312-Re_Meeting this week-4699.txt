Thanks so much for letting us know! Just check Shiftplanning to see what shifts you'll work this next week.

    Hello,

    I'm not going to be able to make the meeting because I'll be flying back from New York.

    I need my Friday 10am-2pm during finals week covered.

    Tuesday I work until 4pm and can take any shift after that.
    Wednesday I can take any shift 6pm or later.
    Thursday I can take any shift.
    Please don't give me all of the 30 hours I just said I was available. 

    Thanks and happy reading week (or reading two days or whatever),

    Will
