Hi NTS,

I apologize for the late notice but I will be unavailable for my office hours this afternoon due to a conflict with a mandatory event I have to attend for class.

If you were planning on coming in to speak to me about anything, feel free to email me. I'm more than willing to reschedule another time either later today or later in the week for you.

Thanks,
Bobby Ramirez
