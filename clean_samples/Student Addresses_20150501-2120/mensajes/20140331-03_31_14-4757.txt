Hey, everyone,

I hope you all enjoyed your spring break. Just a couple of things:

1) Practices will start today, and all practice times will be what they have been for this year (Mondays/Wednesdays 8-10 P.M., Saturdays 12-2 P.M., all at Blomquist gym)

2) Since the KASA Show will happen later this quarter, I have decided that until then we will be setting aside the last 30 minutes of every Monday/Wednesday practices for preparing for it. If you are still interested in joining, you are more than welcome to but we do ask for your commitment. Also, if you would just like to train individually for the last 30 minutes and not partake in preparing for the KASA Show, you may do that as well.

3) No instructions from our masters this first week (as far as I know).

See you guys soon.

Yours,
Davin
