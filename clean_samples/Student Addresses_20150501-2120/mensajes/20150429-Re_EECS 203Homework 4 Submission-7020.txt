    Hi Professor,

    I see that Ali has already contacted you, but here is a copy of my HW4 submission, which I was not able to turn in this morning. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.

    Thank you for your time.

    Best,

        I got a mail from this student, with his homework attached.

            Hello Ali,

            I am a student in Russ Joseph's 11am 203 class. I was unable to attend lecture this morning and as such did not have a chance to submit the homework. I was not sure where I could take the submission, so I am attaching a scan of my work.

            Hopefully this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, and thanks in advance for you time. Also, where is the office, so that I can find it in the future?

            Thank you so much, and please let me know if you need anything else from me.

            Best,
            Ethan Robison
