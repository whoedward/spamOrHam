NTS,

I definitely will not be on campus by Wednesday morning due to extreme delays in my travel schedule. To that end, I would like it if someone could please cover my Wednesday open. On the flip side, I will tell anyone who asks me the harrowing tale of my travel experience to Chicago this week.

From,
Michael Wang
