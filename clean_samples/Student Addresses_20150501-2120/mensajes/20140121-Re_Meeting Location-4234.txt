Hey guys, so I just got word tonight that the rehearsal for the show that I'm working on will be held at the same time as the meeting. I (again, I know) will not be able to attend, but luckily I will not have this conflict next week.

    Hi,

    I've got a pre-interview info session tomorrow night at 6, I'm not sure how long it will last.  I may not be able to make the meeting or will at the least probably be late.
