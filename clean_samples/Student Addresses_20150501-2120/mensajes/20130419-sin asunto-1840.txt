Excelle nt! Thank you very much! I will see if there is anyone; but, at this late hour, who knows?

Best,
Ethan

    Sorry, finders keepers. 

    But srsly, no worries. I am around Tuesday-Thursday, so I can either give it to Maddie in class on Tuesday or I'll be around in the afternoons of those days. 

    Enjoy the museum! And if you know anyone else who wants to go, two people can't go now and will give their tickets away for free.

        Hey Cheryl,

        I wanted to email you to let you know that there is payment for my and Maddie's ticket under your door. I also wanted to let you know that I by accident slipped forty dollars under your door instead of twenty (turns out, they feel the same). Whenever you would like, Maddie or I could stop by your office to grab the extra cash. Thanks!

        Best,
        Ethan
