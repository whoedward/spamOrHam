    I am summing the squares of the oscillations at a particular time. That is to say that I am squaring the values in U and adding them up.

    However, when I use the substitution U = cos(wt)*D and I solve for D I get:

    D = f( ( [-w^2*I] -w*[c1K + c2I]*tan(w*t) + K)^-1

    When I feed this into Matlab it returns the same values for D for all values of t. This happens no matter what omega I choose.

    I have attached my Matlab program. Feel free to ignore if it is too messy or unnecessary.

    Thanks again,
    Ethan
