Hi All,

We still have 4 slots left for the following event.  It is now fully subsidized, so tickets are FREE!  The first 4 people to e-mail me/text me (314-537-4516) with their name number, and e-mail address will get to go:

White Guy on the Bus, Northlight Theater: Ray, a successful white business executive, rides the bus every Saturday. On his weekly ride he befriends Shatique, a young black woman putting herself through school and struggling to raise a son on her own. The threads that tie these disparate individuals together gradually unravel in a complex web of revenge, social mores and racial biases from a candid and unexpected perspective. http://www.northlight.org/

    Event date: Feb 6 (7:00 pm campus depature/campus return by 10 pm)

Thanks,

Jen
