Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a very busy day! We were able to work through the rest of the fight choreo. Fight calls will be run from now on whenever we’re working the scenes they’re in.
    WE HAVE MADE A SLIGHT CHANGE TO THE SCRIPT. It is pretty minor, but will soon be on the Drop Box: Scene 2.3, which is a short bit with Artemidorus, will now be happening directly after Scene 2.4 instead of before it. This will make Emily’s quick change slightly less impossible.

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    Ali (as Young Cato) will be holding a large gun when she comes in for the fight in Scene 5.4, but will also have a knife sheathed on her person somewhere.

Blood Notes:

    We did a ton of fight choreo tonight, so here are some things that came up:

    During the fight (Scene 5.4), we would like for Young Cato (Ali’s) throat to be cut. Will this be possible?
    During the same fight, people will be getting slashed. (This wasn’t clear until today when we went through the actual fight choreo). Just a heads up!
    In Scene 2.1, Portia (Anjali) mentions that she has given herself a wound. The way we blocked it is that Brutus (Matthew) is going to touch the inside of her right thigh where that wound is, and when he brings his hand back it will be bloody. Just another thing to be aware of.

Costume Notes:

    Ali, when she is Young Cato, will need to wearing some sort of belt to draw a knife out of.
    Ali has also voiced that she would really, really appreciate it if her pants were able to accommodate kneepads. (Army pants, of some sort?)
    Please see my email about timing for measurements tomorrow!
