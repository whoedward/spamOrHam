Hey guys!

I'm attaching the notes I took today during the meeting to refresh everyone.  Also please check out the Google Doc Bobby sent out last week; it's updated for tomorrow's agenda.  Feel free to add anything I forgot.

See you guys tomorrow!
Christina

P.S. If you agreed to make a document/guide of some sort, please get on that before the next supervisors meeting (in two weeks) so we have something to show Boss Mike.
