To the Four
	* Musketeers

	* Stooges (including Shemp)

	* Tops
	* Horsemen of the Apocalypse
(You guys need a name.)

Proposal: would you each consider contributing $25 (total $100) to an
apartment fund which would allow us to make small purchases of items
on sale that are on your shopping list?  For example, surge protectors
for the apartment.  Mike would make the final decision and we would
provide receipts for your review.

We have a neighbor offering some furniture (upholstered chaise lounge,
loveseat, two upholstered lounge chairs).  If it works out, we can
store it in our garage for now; offer is pending.  We did accept a
small coffee on your behalf.

Please be thinking of other stuff you may want.  Does anyone have a
basic tool kit?  If you want us to keep an eye out for any appliance
sales, let us know.  We hope you all are having a great summer.


Mark and Mary McCauley
