Fellow AICHE members,

Come to Dow Chemical's Information Session on Thursday April 10th at 6:00 PM in Tech L361. They are looking to connect with students eager to make a difference in Manufacturing & Engineering, Business Management, and Research & Development. Their team will provide a short overview of Dow Chemical followed by a meet and greet with students.

On Friday April 11th, 2014, Mark Weick (McCormick Chemical Engineering Alum '82) will be presenting the keynote address at the Northwestern University Summit on Sustainability Conference hosted by Engineers for a Sustainable World in Ryan Auditorium of Tech. Mark is the Director of Sustainability Programs at Dow and he will be talking about the innovation and partnerships that are key to not only our sustainability performance, but to Dow's overall success as a company. 

See www.nusos.org for more details! The Dow recruiting team will be participating at conference events throughout the weekend.
