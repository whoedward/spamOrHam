Did you guys manage to make a pusher with felt slits this morning? I apologize again for leaving early.

Also,

1) What is the thickness of the steel we used for the frames?

2) does anyone know where to find the McMaster Carr catalog to order the steel? We still need at least two more frames, right?

Assuming we still want to do the 12 lane pusher which, I don't know if we really want to still or not.
