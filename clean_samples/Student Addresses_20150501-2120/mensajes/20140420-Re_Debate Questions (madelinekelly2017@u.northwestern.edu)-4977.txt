Ok I printed this edited one out as long as that's ok with everyone and Morgan is going to email it to her.

    You can always email her with the link, or convert it to a Pages/Word/Offire document and send her that.

        So I am not sure if this other version works. Please let me know. Should I send it to Nichols, or has she already gotten it?
         
         
        Thank you.

            Also if we could make sure my other source is good, that would be great. It has .gov in it, so I think it is legtimate, but I want to make sure

                Hey Guys!
                 
                I edited this to include the rest of the people in the group and added a few words to the questions. If we could look it over for grammar and resend it to Professor Nichols, that would be awesome.
                 
                Thanks.
