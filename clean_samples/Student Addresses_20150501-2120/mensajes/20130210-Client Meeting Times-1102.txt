Hello Professor Holtgreive,

Team Four (DTC section one) would like to know if you have successfully contacted the model bridge building team regarding meeting times. We understand that you will be absent from class this upcoming week, and wanted to make certain to be in touch with you ahead of time.

Thanks,
Team Four
