Happy ID Day!

Get ready for an awesome evening with the FOOD you cooked, AWARDS and a TALENT SHOW!!! 

Here's how today's going to work:
Please be ready to leave at 5:45 PM in the Main Lounge! Exec Members will lead you over to the John Evans Alumni Center (behind Jones). 

Also there is no Open Exec tonight. We will have an email sign up to put up Bathroom Notes and Music Practice Room sheets sent out tonight.
