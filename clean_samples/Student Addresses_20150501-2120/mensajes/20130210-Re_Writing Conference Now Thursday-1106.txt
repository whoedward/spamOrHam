Shit scratch that

IT'S STILL TUESDAY

for some reason we have our writing conference on Tuesday

But we're supposed to prepare for it by Thursday

don't ask me why, look at the syllabus to see if I'm reading it incorrectly

Anyway I recommend we just have the sheets filled out for Tuesday just in case
