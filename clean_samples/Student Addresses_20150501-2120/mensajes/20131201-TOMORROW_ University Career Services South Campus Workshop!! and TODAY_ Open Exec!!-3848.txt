Attention South Campus RC'ers:

RCB invites you to a workshop with 


Have you always wondered what amazing services UCS can provide, but were too intimidated by the long trek up north to find out? We understand. Lincoln street is REALLY. FAR. AWAY. Which is why RCB is bringing UCS to south campus! 

Join us TOMORROW, December 2 at 5:00pm
for an "Orientation to UCS" Workshop
in Shepard RC

All Res Colleges welcome!
Someone will be at the door to let you into Shepard. 

You don't want to miss this rare opportunity to have UCS on south campus. The walk up to Lincoln street is only gonna get colder as we brace ourselves for winter quarter.

Hope to see you there!
