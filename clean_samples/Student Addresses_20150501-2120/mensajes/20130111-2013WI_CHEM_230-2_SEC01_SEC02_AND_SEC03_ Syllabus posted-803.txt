Hello Everyone,

So I posted the syllabus under the "my group" tab on blackboard and attaching it to this email. It's quite long but please read all of it and email me questions you may have. Due the questions I got on wednesday, a few things have changed (and are indicated in the syllabus). For Example:
1) All lab reports are to be typed
2) Prelab must be written in your notebook and formatted as shown in the syllabus (the table can vary a lil)
3) Office hours will just be at Einsteins

I know the prelab looks daunting but I'd rather you spend time preparing so that we all can get into lab and get out before 11pm :). No worries there will be no quizes and after the first two prelabs, it becomes real easy and fast.

Have a great weekend all,
Cornelius
