Hey, guys,

Because of the overwhelming responses I got (just kidding), I'm just going to have to select a place and time for this meeting :) I'm thinking we can start the meeting at 10:30 A.M. at Clarke's and then people can head on over to Blomquist afterwards so that we can still hold a Saturday practice for those who want to have one last practice session before the belt test. Let me know if there are any questions or concerns. Again, it would be great to have all black belts and senior members for this meeting. Thanks, guys.
