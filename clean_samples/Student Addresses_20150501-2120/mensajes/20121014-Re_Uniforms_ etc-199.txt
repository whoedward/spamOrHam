I'd be happy to order you a uniform, but you have to realize that it is past the deadline for ordering. The reason there was a deadline last time was because if I ordered all the uniforms all at once, I would only have to pay for shipping and handling once for the whole bundle, instead of a shipping cost for each individual uniform.

The cost of the uniform by itself is 20 dollars. The shipping fee is $10, so since this is only a single order, I'll have to charge you the uniform and shipping, which is 30 dollars. Is that okay? Also, I was sure you already had a uniform...

I've also added your friend to the listserv.

    Hello,

    Firstly, I apologize for the late response to the email regarding uniforms. I am interested in a uniform, and would like one of a size of either 4 or 5. I say either because I am 5' 8" and about 170-175 pounds (a.k.a., right at the threshold). I would prefer a size 4, unless you think that it would be too restrictive. Your opinion is respected here.

    On another note, a friend of mine wishes to be added to the mailing list. Her email is: madelinemcfee2016@u.northwestern.edu. Please add her. As well, she should be sending you an email regarding her uniform size shortly. If there is anything else that you need, please feel free to mention it.

    Thanks,
    Ethan
