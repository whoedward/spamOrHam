Hi,

This email is meant for Section 22 (lab hours:11am to noon) but others are also welcome to benefit from it if they have trouble understanding functions.

Attached are the two m-files which demonstrate the use of functions. Both of them have comments to help you understand the code.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks
Paritosh
