Hi guys!

I hope everyone is having a great week. For this week's social, we will be having a sundae bar in the blue lounge on Thursday some time after 10PM so bring your bowls! 

For Dillo Day, please come find me either on friday night or saturday morning to get your wristbands. If you cannot find me, there will also be a CA by the entrance of ISRC throughout the day who can give them to you as well. Your guests will also need to get a wristband. You will need to get the wristbands to access the buildings in the J1F area on Dillo Day.

Finally, if anyone is leaving before the end of classes next week, PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP so I can walk you through closing procedures. 

E-mail me if you have any questions and get excited for DILLO!

Best,
Danny
