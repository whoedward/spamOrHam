Hey Nathan,
We emailed you asking you to sign up for a training date. 
Here is the link:
https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/document/d/1gKNtGmBWRKRxbcb7TjxUAf0ildaHAAX2BkKK_EpPr9w/edit

You signed up, but you signed up for a date that already happened. 
We need you to sign up for one of the other two dates. 

Thanks,
William Hyun
