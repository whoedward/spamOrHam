Hi everyone!

As many of you already know, Monday, Jan. 20th, is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. To commemorate Dr. King, the university has a lot of events on campus that day. There will be performances, guest speakers, and service opportunities, all of which can be found on the attached poster or at the link below. Try to use this day off to attend some of these events and celebrate the legacy of Dr. King.
