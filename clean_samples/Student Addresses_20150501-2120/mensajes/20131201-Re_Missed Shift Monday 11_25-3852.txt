No problem, thanks for getting back to me. These things happen, though we do still have to hold you accountable for the missed shift. Please be advised that any further infractions will result in a written statement and a possible probationary period.

    Hey Bobby,
    I'm sorry it's taken me a few days to get back to you about this; I haven't had much access to my computer this break.  The Monday shift thing was a silly mistake on my part.  I set my alarm clock for PM rather than AM and missed that.  Bit unfortunate but that's something that won't happen again now that I'm sure to check for it!  Lemm know if there's anything else you'd like to know.

    Alex

        Hi Alex,

        I wanted to follow up about your missed shift this morning. You did not show up for the 8am-10am open. As of right now this constitutes an unexcused missed shift and requires us to warn you that any further infractions will result in disciplinary action. 

        If there was any type of misunderstanding or if there is anything that we can do to help prevent this from occurring again, please let us know.
