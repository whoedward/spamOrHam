Just a reminder: For IFN tonight, we will be watching a German comedy film called "Good Bye, Lenin!" -- a coming-of-age adventure that blends the fall of Communism in East Germany with the salient emotions of a family love. Released in 2003, the film was well-received and won various awards, including Deustcher Filmpreis, a German equivalent of the Academy Award.  Come to the basement at 8PM and enjoy the movie !

Best,
Arkar
