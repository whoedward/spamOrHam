Ok, so you're using the system version of undetermined coefficients. Remember that for a cosine you either guess a particular solution that includes sin and cos, matching up terms after you substitute, or you replace cos(w t) with e^(i w t ), use e^(i w t) in the particular solution and take real part of the solution at the end.

Note that the assumption in undetermined coefficients is that the D vector is constant over time, it actually should not depend on t.
