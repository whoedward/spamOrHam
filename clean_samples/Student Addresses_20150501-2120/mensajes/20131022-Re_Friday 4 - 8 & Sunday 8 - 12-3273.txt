    Hey guys, I'm going to be in Rockford this weekend for a tournament and we leave at 5 pm on Friday and probably won't be back till late Sunday so if anyone could help me out that would be awesome.

    Friday 4 - 8 is generally pretty chill because all of the events have already been set up and don't often end till after 8.

    Sunday 8 - 12 is the best because there is nothing to set up and only the occasional clean-up (which is rare).
