I like how you included doge in there... lol
Maybe end of February would be good for Tier 2 training deadline
and.... "keeping meetings short and sweet" might be another goal.
I guess it'll be naturally shorter cuz we don't have ryan events though... 

maybe we can somehow encourage people to come to the meetings?
It doesn't seem really fair to force the ones that always come to the meetings to cover all the shifts all the time..

    Hey guys!

    Sorry to disturb you on break, but I figured this would be a good time to make a quick list of goals we want to do next quarter.  I made a Google Doc of examples; they don't have to be the actual ones, of course.  Let me know what you think!
