Hi Nelson,

Don't worry about coming in for your 10am shift today. There isn't much going on and I just spoke with Michael and he's okay with Will covering that shift by himself for today.

Since nobody took the shift, I just asked if Will can handle it on his own just this once (it's usually a really chill shift) and he agreed. Hope that's okay!
