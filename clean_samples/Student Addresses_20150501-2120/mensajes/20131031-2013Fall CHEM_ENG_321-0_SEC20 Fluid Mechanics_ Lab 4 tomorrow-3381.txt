Dear Class,

Lab 4 will take place tomorrow, Friday November 1.  In addition, your lab reports from Lab 2 will be graded and returned to you.  I will spend a few minutes at the beginning of the lab to discuss common issues that I saw during grading in order to help remedy these for the next lab report due next week.  As usual, I will hold office hours on Monday and Tuesday next week to answer any questions.

Also, I have gotten several questions about the days of the next two labs after this one.  All dates are listed in your syllabus, but just for your reference, Lab 5 will take place on November 8 and Lab 6 will be on November 15.  There will be no lab report due for Lab 6, but you will still be receiving participation credit and must use those data for your homework.  In addition, remember that failure to complete any of the labs will result in an incomplete in the course, as per the syllabus.

See you all tomorrow,

Erica
