Hey everyone,

Due to a change of plans, I will be testing water pistols AFTER open exec. The service point opportunity still stands if you would like to help me out. With that in mind, I will be handing out water pistols at time to be determined this week.

Sorry for the change, and keep a look out for another announcement!

    Hey everyone,

    Assassins will be starting soon, but before I can begin the game, I need to test out all of the water pistols I got the other day. If you would like to help me test them out, I'll be in the main lounge at 7pm tomorrow Sunday.

    Also, I will be handing out water pistols after open exec. There are 4 different types of water pistols, so it's a first-come first-serve for water pistols tomorrow.

    Thanks!
    Thomas
