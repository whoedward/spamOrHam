    Hey supers,

    So we misunderstood the shifts required for this Hardin Hall thing, and these are the shifts:

    Monday 8:30-9:30 am
    Monday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
    Tuesday 8:30-9:30 am - Christina
    Tuesday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
    Tuesday 3-5 PM - Big Mike & 

    Currently I am on the Monday morning on Shiftplanning, but I technicallyyyy have class I should go to.  Is anyone able?
    We just need that and someone to help tear down with Big Mike on Tuesday.  The set-up is a snake from their system into our mixer with four wireless kits.  Super simple.

    Thanks, guys!
