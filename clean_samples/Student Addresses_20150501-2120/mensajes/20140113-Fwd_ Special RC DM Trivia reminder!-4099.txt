RCB DM Trivia Night!
Thursday, January 16, 6:00pm
@Buffalo Wild Wings
$5 Suggested Donation goes to your RC's DM team
Winning team gets a $25 BWW giftcard
Every team must have a fellow or master!

RCB has been working with DM to put on a special, res college-exclusive trivia night! This is a great way to get your fellows and master staff more involved in Dance Marathon.

Like other DM trivia nights, it will take place at Buffalo Wild Wings, and there is a suggested $5 donation. But there are two twists that make this trivia night more fun:

1) Only teams representing res colleges will be allowed to participate
2) Every team must have at least one fellow/master!

We hope to see you all there!

Laura Stoughton
RCB VP of Academic Affairs
