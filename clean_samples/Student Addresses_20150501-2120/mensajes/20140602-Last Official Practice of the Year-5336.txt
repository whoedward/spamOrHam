Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you guys know once again that today is our last official practice and that it would be really cool to have all of you guys there. See you soon!

Yours,
Davin

P.S. If you need a belt testing form, please let me know. The test is this Wednesday at Blomquist. Come by 8 P.M. that day.
