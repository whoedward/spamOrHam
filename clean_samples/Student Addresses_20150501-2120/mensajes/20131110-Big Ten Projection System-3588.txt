Hey Guys,

I just walked into the Big Ten room to find the projector still on. The event in Big Ten ended at 4:30, which means that the projector had been on for at least five and a half hours. Additionally, the sheets have no signature down for clean-up. Please make sure to check rooms periodically throughout your shifts, and please be aware that, if something happens on a shift and no one signs the sheets, both of you will be held accountable for issues.

Regards,
