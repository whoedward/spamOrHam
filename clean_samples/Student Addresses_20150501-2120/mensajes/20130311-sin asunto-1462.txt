Hello all,

Back by popular demand, ISRC reading week yoga is a go. We can fit about ten people in the main lounge for some chill evening yoga with Chelsea. We'll provide the mats; you just show up ready to get your om on!  

If you are interested in coming to yoga on Thursday at 8pm in the main lounge, send me an email and ill save you a spot! 

Now study hard (or sleep if you danced for 26 hours)! 

C
