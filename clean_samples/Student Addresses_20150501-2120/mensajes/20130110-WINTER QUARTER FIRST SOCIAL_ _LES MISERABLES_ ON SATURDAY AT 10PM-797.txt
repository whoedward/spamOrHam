Hi guys!

Happy New Year and welcome back! I hope everyone has had a great winter break and has come back fresh and ready to hit the ground running for this new quarter! We are incredibly lucky to welcome a new member to our floor: Matthew Walsh living in room 312 in suite Russia. Matt is an ISRC veteran who has just returned from study abroad in Milan and will be a fantastic addition to our floor. For our first floor social of the quarter, we will be going to watch critically acclaimed "Les Mis√©rables" this saturday night at the Century 12 Cinema in Evanston. The movie is at 10PM so we will be meeting outside my room at 9:40PM to walk over as a group. Please E-mail me to let me know if you will be coming so I know who to wait for. Have a great weekend and I hope to see you there!

Best,
Danny
