Hey everyone,

Sorry this is so last minute, but Blom is closed today for the game. Last year, Blom was open even on game days, so I didn't think this was going to be a problem. Anyways, bring your sparring gear to Monday's practice if you have it. We now officially have only 2 Saturday practices until Purdue.

Personally, 2 sparring practices before a tournament is not enough preparation for me. So I'm going to be in Blomquist tomorrow (Sunday) at 3. This is not an official practice by the slightest. Join me if you want. Leave when you want. I'm going to do sparring drills till I drop. It'd be nice if I had a practice partner, though.

Ji-hoon
