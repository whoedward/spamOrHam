All,

It turns out I gave you all the wrong problem for yesterday's DailyQ, which resulted in you all getting it wrong. The problem should have said "guess what random number with more than three significant digits I'm thinking of" instead.

In all seriousness, I entered the answer into Blackboard incorrectly. I've gone back in and given full credit to anybody who had approximately 53.6 (give or take). I've also attached a solution to this problem below.

If you got the correct answer and I haven't given you credit for it, or you were otherwise disadvantaged by this setback (within reason), let me know.

Sorry for the annoyance!

Karna
