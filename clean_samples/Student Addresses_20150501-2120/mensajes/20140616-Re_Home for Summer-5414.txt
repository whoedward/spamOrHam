    Yeah, That’s probably the easiest way.    I can do that for everybody.

    Hey Michael,

     

    I've been trying to deactivate my account and I'm getting a message that says: "Administrative accounts cannot be de-activated."  So I made myself an employee, but I don't think I can deactivate anything now.  Could you see if you are able to?  If not, I'll keep fiddling.

     

    Thanks,

    Christina

        Hey folks,

        If you are going home, or already there…I need you to deactivate your Shiftplanning account.  Don’t erase it, jut deactivate.  The reason why is we pay per active account.  We want only the people working this summer active.

         

        Thanks,

         

        Enjoy your summer.
