Hey, guys,

First off, congratulations to all those who participated at the tournament test today. You guys all did really well! I look forward to your next step of achievements in the coming quarters :) A huge thanks also to all those who helped out at the tournament test. From what I've heard from a lot of people, this event went a lot more smoothly this time around. So a huge shout out to you guys as well :)

Secondly, I know that some of us may be stressed from finals. In light of that, even though we don't have formal practices this week, I'd like to open up the Blomquist floor space on Monday and Wednesday during our regular practice time (although, I think Blomquist may close at 9 P.M. this week) for people to just come and practice and take a study break. So if you guys need to relieve your stress somehow, come out and join us then :)

Hope you guys do well on your finals. Have a great Christmas break for those I won't see again this quarter :)

Yours,
Davin
