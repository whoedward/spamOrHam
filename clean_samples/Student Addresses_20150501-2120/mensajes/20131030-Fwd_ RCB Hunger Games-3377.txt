Hi ISRC!

The Residential College Board is hosting the 2nd Annual RCB Hunger Games THIS SUNDAY (11/2/13)!! I know we have at least three hardy, battle-ready ISRC-ers who have volunteered as tribute, but I'd love for us to have more. Want to sign up? Check out the link below!! And may the odds be ever in your favor!

ISRC-Love (and Happy Halloween!!),

Nathan



WANT TO SHOW YOUR WORTH?
Volunteer as tribute in
the 2nd Annual 
RCB HUNGER GAMES 
on November 2 at NOON.
(That's 2.5 hours before the FB game.)

If you've read this far, you get a hint:
The arena will be TECH!

PRIZES: Movie Gift Card and more!
Sign-up by emailing jennhuang@u.northwestern.edu today! *
