I can do 3:15 - 4. I'm on shift from 4-6, but I can stick around from 6-6:45. Is that possible to do?

    Hey All,

    The group in the Louis North room on Wednesday, the second of October would like to hire an extra technician. Equipment will be just a laptop and a microphone. It is worth noting that this will be considering an out of house event, so whoever takes can swipe in for off-site pay.

    Best,
    Ethan
