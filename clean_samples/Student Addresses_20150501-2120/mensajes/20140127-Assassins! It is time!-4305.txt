Here's a few last reminders:

1) When you report a kill, be sure to include when and where the kill occurred.

2) Even if you aren't an assassin, you can still participate! Be on the lookout for murderous assassins!

3) Remember to be careful around icy ground and stairwells! We don't want any accidents.

That is all, now bring me entertainment. :D
