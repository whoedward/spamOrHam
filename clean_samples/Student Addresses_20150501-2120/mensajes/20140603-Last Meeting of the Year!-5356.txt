Hi everyone,

Our last meeting this year will be in the Lake Room from 7-8pm. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason. In addition, please make sure you have emailed ALL of your remaining shift coverages to us even if you are coming to the meeting, in order to speed up the process.

Thanks for a great year!
