Great Muay Thai practice today guys!

There were some questions about what equipment you should get. Handwraps and boxing gloves are a great place to start.

For the handwraps, I would recommend Ringside as a good brand, and these handwraps in particular:

For gloves, make sure you get 16 oz gloves, and I would recommend Ringside IMF Techs as a great option. Most gloves from Ringside, Title, Fighting, or Hayabusa should do pretty well. Email me if you have any questions about specific gear.

Alright guys, See you next Sunday!
