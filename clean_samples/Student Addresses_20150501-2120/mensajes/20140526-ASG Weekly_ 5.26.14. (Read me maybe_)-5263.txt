Hey guys!

Only a couple weeks left in the year, which means only a few more of these emails. There's a lot of cool opportunities included though so have a read.

Senate is voting this Wednesday whether or not to completely reform the structure of RCB/RHA senators. If the legislation passes there will be two senators representing all of J1F instead of one for Jones/CRC/ISRC and one for Hinman. This changes how your voice will be represented, so if you have any questions or concerns please speak to me. I'm personally not in full favor of the changes and I'm more than happy to discuss them with anyone interested. 

Also, hidden this week: a wicked relevant animal picture. 

Take care,
Swiatek

Apply for the Analytics Committe!!

Are you interested in conducting studies that will have an impact on the entire student body? Do you want to help student government leaders make better decisions through data collection, analysis, and presentation? Apply for the analytics committee!

The analytics committee is an interdisciplinary committee that creates surveys, gauges campus interest, and performs data analysis in order to better inform student government on crucial campus issues. The ideal candidate is passionate about the campus community and has experience with data collection, surveying, or programming. 

Applications are due tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27th. If you have any questions contact our VP for analytics, Grant Nicholas, at asg-analytics@u.northwestern.edu. Apply here! 

Apply to be a Pre-Med Peer Mentor!
	
	

The premed track can be extremely challenging, and new premed students often struggle to adapt to the program. Think back to your freshman year- there was probably a time you wish someone had warned you about a professor, helped you choose extracurricular groups, or just consoled you over your first bio exam grade. You can be that person for the Class of 2018!

Phi Delta Epsilon, One Step Before, the Undergraduate Premedical Society, and Associated Student Government are looking for rising upperclassmen with strong premed records and enthusiasm for guiding new students to join their new premed peer mentoring program.

Applications are due May 30 at 5 pm to nu.ppmp@gmail.com. 

Sign up for ReNUvation!

Every year ASG organizes a neighborhood cleanup of the streets immediately west of campus the morning after Dillo Day. After a fun day of celebrating, this is students' chance to give back to the Evanston community and take responsibility for making sure all the leftover Dillo trash is disposed of.

The more volunteers we have, the quicker we'll be able to leave the neighborhood as we left it. We'll be meeting at 9am on 6/1 outside Kellogg. Gloves, garbage bags, and bagels will all be provided! Please sign up to volunteer here!

Apply to be a Student Life Committee Director

Applications for Student Life Committee Director positions are now open. Directors serve as the SLVP’s right-hand area-expert on specific realms of student life, such as dining, transportation and campus safety, mental health, and residential life. Directors will interact with administrators frequently, so professionalism is a must! Time commitment: 5 hours per week. Anyone can apply! Applications are below. 

    Director of Dining Initiatives
    Director of Transportation & Campus Safety Initiatives
    Director of Residential Life Initiatives
    Director of Mental Health Initiatives
    Director of University Center Initiatives

Email Chris Harlow, VP for Student Life, at asg-studentlife@u.northwestern.edu if you have any questions. 

Join the CTEC Working Group

Do you think the CTEC system is outdated? unattractive? confusing? or just ineffective?
You aren't alone. ASG's Academic Committee is looking for undergraduates interested in serving on faculty/student working groups that will analyze the CTEC experience and make a proposal to the university's CTEC committee.

Groups will meet once this quarter and several times in the fall. Please email asg-academic@u.northwestern.edu with questions or to express interest.

Find Work on JobCat!

JobCat connects busy Evanston residents with Northwestern students who want to help. From babysitting to administrative work, JobCat is a great way to get involved in the Evanston community and make some money in the process.
