Hey everyone!

Come out and celebrate the fact that the weather's actually behaving like spring with GELATO this Thursday (May 1) at 4:30 in the main lounge.

It'll probably run for about an hour, so feel free to drop by when you can and chat with some of our awesome fellows.

So. Thursday. 4:30. Main lounge. BE THERE.

GELATOGELATOGELATO

Your fellows chair,
Coretta
