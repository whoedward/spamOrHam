Hey everyone,

Here is the ISRC points list. Use this spreadsheet as a guide to how many points you have and how many points you need to make it to a list. The more points you get, the higher list you will be on, and the higher list you are on, the better chance you have to live here next year and pick a larger room, run for an exec position, and more!

Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av4OS4eBjonVdGgzSTlFbkl5bG5hRlRteENxa3pkQnc&usp=sharing

I will update this list at least once a week. If you have any questions about points and what-not, feel free to ask me.

Thanks!

Thomas
