Fellow ChemE's,

This is a good place for you to present your design/research work. If you're unsure of how to proceed, talk to your advisor and see below:

The annual AIChE Chicago section student poster session is the evening of April 9 at IIT.  It includes a poster session (for undergrads and grads), dinner, and a talk, all for quite cheap ($5).  There are awards for best poster.  Please encourage any students (especially undergrads) who may be doing research in your laboratories or would have a course project that could be turned into a poster to submit one.  Additional information about the student night should be coming up soon on the AICHE Chicago website.
