Hello again!
 
First of all, please email me if you were at the Movie Marathon fundraiser on Saturday and would like a philanthropy point.  Second of all, I have a great volunteer opportunity through RCB at the Shedd Aquarium for anyone interested!  Well, technically you'll be working at the garden outside Shedd from 9-12 on Sunday, May 19, but you'll get free admission to the aquarium afterwards.  Unfortunately, there is limited space, so only 2-3 people from ISRC will be able to go.  If you want to go, email me AT 5PM TOMORROW!  I will send out a reminder email right before 5, and I will try to guarantee spots to the first 2-3 people who email me, and anyone else will be put on the waitlist.  If you decide not to go, you must tell me before Saturday at 5pm, and if no one is on the waitlist, you must find a replacement for yourself.  See the flyer below for more info!
 
Thanks,
Ayla
