I'm covering Braelyn's 4-6pm this Wednesday, and she's taking my 8-10am this Friday.  Can anyone cover my 10am-12pm this Friday?  I just released it on shiftplanning.

                    Hi everyone,

                    I just found out one my classes is having an exam review session during this time. I would really appreciate it if someone could cover this for me. I released the shift on Shiftplanning.

                    Thanks,
                    Braelyn
