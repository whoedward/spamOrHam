Hi NTS,

Here are the meeting notes from tonight.

Announcements:

Training this Saturday will be in Lake Room, from 9am to 12pm, possibly earlier. There will be breakfast provided. Please note that you have to attend at least one of the training sessions. There will be another next week.

For events that require projectors, please try to turn them on 1 hour before the event at the earliest and turn them off one hour after the event at the latest. This helps save the lamps in the projectors and allows us to have more fun things, such as t-shirts and food.

Please be on time for shifts, we will start giving out warnings to people who are coming in excessively late or late multiple times.

Remember your shift coverages; as soon as you say you will switch with someone, it becomes your shift and the same disciplinary measure apply as a normal shift.

Ryan Events

New Techs: If you have not shadowed a Ryan event yet, there are a lot going on this weekend. If you can stop whenever you are available to shadow the event, you can learn how to use the Ryan system and then take Ryan events by yourself. You will be paid for any hours that you shadow.

Note:  For Ryan events, if the client has not arrived 2 hours after the event start time,  you can leave the event.
