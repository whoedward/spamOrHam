    Hello Everyone!

    It's that time again!  Everyone must complete a Spring Evaluation in order to qualify for a (drumroll please...) 5 cent raise!  At least I think it's 5 cents...

    But you must do your eval!  IT SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AT THE MOST.  Wednesday is my designated day this week:  if you would like to just blast this thing out of the way, I will available:

    Wednesday, 5/29
    2-4 pm
    6-7 pm
    8-9 pm

    Email me with a time (and reply all so that we don't overlap), and I'll meet you in the Tech Lounge.

    Let's get pumped people!

    Marina
