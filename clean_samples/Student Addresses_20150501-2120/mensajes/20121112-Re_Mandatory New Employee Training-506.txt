Hello Meredith,

I was wondering if it would be okay if I showed up slightly late to the meeting (I have class on Wednesday until 9:50 a.m. in Tech), on account of scheduling conflicts that show up otherwise. I should be able to make it to orientation by 10:05 a.m.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    Hey guys, 
    I just wanted to send a reminder to fill out the spreadsheet for a mandatory orientation session, there is one tomorrow, so please don't put off signing up for your session! There are about 75 of you and only 20 of you have signed up so far.  Here's the spreadsheet again.

    If none of the times work for you, let me know.

    Thanks,
    Meredith

        Hey New Norris Employees, 

        It's Meredith, your friendly neighborhood SSDM! Welcome to the Norris family! I hope you've all started to get settled into your new positions at Norris and are LOVING IT as you darn well should.

        You should have all been trained within your individual department, but now it's time for you all to learn where you fit within Norris as a community. I will be hosting three orientation sessions in the upcoming weeks, where I'll be sharing with you the goals of Norris, telling you a little bit about how everything in Norris runs, and showing you around the building to get you acquainted, and to get you all acquainted with each other. I've got three options listed below, and attendance at one of the meetings is mandatory. 

        Friday, 11/9 2PM, Rock Room
        Wednesday, 11/14 10AM, Wildcat Room A
        Monday, 11/19 5:30PM, Wildcat Room B

        Fill out this spreadsheet with your name, and mark the meeting you'll be attending. If you can't make any of these times, let me know and I'll see what I can do about planning another session.  Plan on being in Norris for about an hour.


        See you soon!

        Norris love,

        Meredith
