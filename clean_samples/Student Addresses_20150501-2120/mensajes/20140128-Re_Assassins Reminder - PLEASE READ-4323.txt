1 more reminder: We will consider "work" in the same terms as "class." In other words, assassinations going to or from work is perfectly acceptable, as is going to and from class. HOWEVER, no killings may occur during work, just like no killings allowed during any class.

    Hey everyone,

    I love the enthusiasm so far, but please keep in mind some of the more important rules:

    1) Safe hours are from 1am-6am.
    2) ANY ISRC resident and non-res can be a witness.

    Keep at it!

    Thomas
