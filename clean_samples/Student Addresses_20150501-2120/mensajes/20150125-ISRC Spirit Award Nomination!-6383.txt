Hi ISRC!

The ISRC Spirit Award recognizes someone in our community who truly embodies what it means to live in ISRC. This is not necessarily the person who goes to the most events, but a person who shows great enthusiasm, and embraces everything ISRC. 

If you know someone who you believe has the most ISRC spirit, please use this form below to nominate them. Nominations are due by February 1st.

After nominations close, I will send out an official ballot for people to cast their vote. The winner of the award will be announced at International Dinner on Sunday, February 22nd. 

ISRCLove,
Esteban
