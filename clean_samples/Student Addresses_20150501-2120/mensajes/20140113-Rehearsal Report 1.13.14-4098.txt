Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a good day of working through some scenes that we had already blocked but needed to revisit. We looked at the end of Act 1 again (some polishing with lines still needs to be done),  and we were also able to run through and then go back and work everything we’ve blocked in Act II.
    We’ll be blocking and then running through the final two scenes of the show tomorrow! We’ll also be reviewing fight choreo, which may require some extra time.

Scenery Notes:

    Just making sure that for scene 4.1 we will have a table and two chairs.
