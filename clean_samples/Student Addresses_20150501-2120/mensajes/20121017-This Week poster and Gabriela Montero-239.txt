Hello everyone -

This is your weekly poster email from Pick-Staiger.

I wanted to remind you that the amazing pianist Gabriela Montero<http://www.pickstaiger.org/event/gabriela-montero-piano> is performing tomorrow night. If any of your community members are interested in attending, we offer group discounts and can easily take chart string numbers as payment.

I also wanted to let you know that we may just be giving away a few pairs of tickets on facebook and twitter today and tomorrowâ€¦hint hint. Definitely check out our pages throughout the day!

Take care,
C~
