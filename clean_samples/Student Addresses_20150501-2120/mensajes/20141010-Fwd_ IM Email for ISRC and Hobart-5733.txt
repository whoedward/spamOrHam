Hey what's up guys?!!

My name is Dominique Mejia, and I'm the Sports Chair for Chapin RC and the captain of our joint Football Team between Chapin, ISRC, and Hobart! My job is essentially to keep everyone informed about game times, locations, who we're playing against, what we need to wear and keeping track of the roster! Last week was our first game, and I apologize for not sending an email earlier, but I hope to make up for that now with awesome gifs!

So this weekend we are playing on Sunday at 12:00 pm against CRC and we need to wear WHITE!! Chapin is planning on catching an 11:34 am shuttle at the Arch to Long Field, and you guys are more than welcome to come with us, or you guys can meet us at Long Field, whatever works best for you guys! Another thing that's important is that we really need more girls to show up to games, in order to have our guy/girl ratio up so we don't have to forfeit!  Plus, who doesn't like to see some girls kick some ass?!?!?!Black And White Draco Malfoy animated GIF

Lastly, if you haven't given your NetID to your Sports Chair, and you plan on playing football this quarter, please send that ASAP, so that I can add you to the official roster! All people are welcome, whether you've played football before in high school or even if you don't know what football is! IM games are meant to be fun, and  we are all here to help each other out, so come out and play, and meet some new people!! If you have any questions ask your Sports Chair or email me!
