    Anyone available to meet with me tomorrow at 1pm?  Alex S, I see you’re already on shift, so you’re one.  Hoping for at least one other person.  Thanks!

    As you navigate through the rest of your life, be open to collaboration.  Other people and other people's ideas are often better than your own.  Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.  - Amy Poehler
