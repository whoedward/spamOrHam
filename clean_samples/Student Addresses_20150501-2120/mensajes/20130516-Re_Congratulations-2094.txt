Hello Michael,

I can most easily come to the Friday meetings.

Thanks,
Ethan

    Hello,

    Congratulations for being part of the 2013-2014 leadership for NTS.  As a tech Supervisor you will have many challenges as well as rewards ahead of you.  I am very excited about this upcoming year.  I think we have assembled an awesome team of supervisors.  Now, for the first of many hurdles- I’d like to get you to some of our Supervisors meetings in order to start conversations between yourselves and outgoing Supers.  We meet on Tuesdays from 1-2 pm and on Fridays from 3-4 pm.  Please let me know which meeting you can make it to, you do not need to go to both meetings. 

    At these meetings I’d like you to ask lots of questions.  Hopefully between myself and the other Supers we will be able to answer them all.

     

    Early next fall we will get into the nitty gritty of Supervisor training at JumpStart.  All of your questions about “How do I Supervise?” will be answered.  Until then I’d like you to try to attend our bi-weekly meetings and be a part of the team.

     

    Please let me know if you have any questions.  I am going to send out a schedule of weekly meetings shortly.

     

    Thanks,

     

    Michael
