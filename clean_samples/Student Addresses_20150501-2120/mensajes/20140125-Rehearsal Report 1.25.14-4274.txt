Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a very busy day! It was a very good final run through before Shanley. Blood was incredibly helpful, and it was great to see at least part of the eventual effects their work will have. We went through a fight call, after which blood explained their apparatuses to us, and we were able to run through the fights with the blood apparatuses filled with water. It was immensely useful. Thank you guys so much for coming!
    The cast was on it today. Very focused, very aware. We had a tech/homework-free rehearsal so that no one sitting on the sidelines was distracted, and it made a big difference.
    Official run time for the show: 1 hr. 56 mins. Act I—1 hr. 18 mins; Act II—38 mins.
    Today felt great. We are very ready for tech week! Thank you all so much for your hard work so far.

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    Just checking, it’s likely you already knew this—there’s a piece of money offered by Lucilius (Grace) as a bribe at the end of the fight in scene 5.4. Do we have that/can we get that?

Costume Notes:

    Thank you for coming! I will send you the notes I took.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    See you tomorrow!
