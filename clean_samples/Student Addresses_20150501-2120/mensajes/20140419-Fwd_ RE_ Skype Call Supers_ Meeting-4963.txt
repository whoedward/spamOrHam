How about Google hang out?  We could form a circle.  In hang out we can all have a screen shot.  I'm cool with the idea.

PS.   you'll have to remind me to manually enter your hours for anything not happening at Norris, such as video chat.

Michael,

We, the supers, had an idea at the staff meeting to do a Skype call for
the supervisors' meetings. It would be after hours, but we could all be
there, something we can't do at the moment. Let us know what you think,
and I totally understand if it's an issue of personal time vs. work time.
