Sorry guys, I accidentally sent that email before finishing it!!!! 

Just one correction - when you email me your name and suite, please include the food item(s)/amount of money you donated. :) Oh, and the birthday kit (see list below) will be 2 points instead of 1. You can do the food drive without doing the zombie walk, or the zombie walk without doing the food drive, or both, or neither. :) If you have any questions, email me!!!

ISRClove,
Ayla
