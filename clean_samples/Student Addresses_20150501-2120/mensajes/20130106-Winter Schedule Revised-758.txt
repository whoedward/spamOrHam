Hi NTS,

There were some conflicts with the original schedule, so here is the new tentative schedule for this quarter.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdHBCUURZazNsLUpzRzBIaFdDQmlpSUE

THIS SCHEDULE IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. Please check the schedule to see if you have any shifts tomorrow. If you miss your shift, the same disciplinary measure still apply.

If there are still any problems with the schedule please email back ASAP. I am checking to see if we are having our weekly meeting at the usual time.

Thanks,

Alex
