Residents of ISRC, CRC, and Jones!

For those of you who do not know me, my name is Eric Morales, I am a Freshman in SESP, and more importantly, the new ASG Senator for RCB 4, which is you! 

Basically what this means is that any problems you may have, in regards to the university that is, can be brought to me, and I will see what I can do. Now this does not have to just be dorm related issues, though I realize that will be the most common occurrence. Problems with academics, student life, groups, etc., you can let me know and I can see what I can do. 

On that note, my contact info is below, I should be reachable just about always. 

I've already heard some feedback about ASG's latest round of legislation, so I'm going to be sending out polls anytime legislation is made, so that I can get your opinion on it. That way your voice is being heard, and I'm doing my job by representing your opinion, as opposed to mine! I realize that answering polls is a pain, but it should never take more than 10 seconds.

Well that's it for my long email! Please contact me, I'm really pushing for communication so that the smaller dorms here on South Campus get their say.

I'm also in ISRC 2nd floor, and eat at Hinman most of the time, so if you need to complain, you know where to find me!

Thanks,
