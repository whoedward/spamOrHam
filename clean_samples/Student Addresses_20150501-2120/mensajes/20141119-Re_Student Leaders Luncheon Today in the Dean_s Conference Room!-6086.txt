    Hello,

    This is to let you know that there is a student leaders luncheon taking place today from 12:00-12:50 in the Dean's Conference Room (L250). This luncheon will be an opportunity to interact with other student leaders, discuss upcoming events, and help improve the McCormick student group experience. Additionally, Dean Ottino will be there, and will be talking about some student groups and initiatives that are on their way for McCormick. The lunch is free and delicious!

    If you have any (albeit last minute) questions, please let me know!

    Best,
