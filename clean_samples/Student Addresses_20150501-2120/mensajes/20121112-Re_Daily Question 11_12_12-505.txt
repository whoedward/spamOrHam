Professor,

Upon rereading the question, I realize that no picture is necessary. Please disregard the last message.

Thanks again,

    Hello Professor,

    On today's daily question there is an attached image (or at least it seems that way). I cannot view the image in Chrome or Firefox. Is there a link to the image that you could send out, please?

    Thanks,
    Ethan Robison
