Hey supers!

I won't be back on campus till 9/25 so I won't be able to make my 9/24 shifts and meeting. Also, during the meeting would it be possible to see if anyone wants to trade my Sunday morning and Wednesday morning shifts? It would be awesome if I could get night shifts (8-midnight preferably) cus I really am not a morning person :p

Anyways, thanks a bunch and see y'all soon!:) 

Best, 

Angela
