The carts that were available for move in at the beginning of the year have arrived, and are now available for use to move out.

If you need to use a cart to move out, call the CA Duty Phone and meet them at Hinman CA Office (first floor by the main staircase).  You will need to leave your ID there in order to check out a cart, and the cart must be returned before you can check out of your room.

Any questions about move out, check the bulletin boards throughout the building or contact your CA.
