This spring break, Northwestern University Habitat for Humanity is sending TWO trips to Florida! We are sending one trip to PENSACOLA, FL and another to LAKELAND, FL. 

ANYONE can go on this trip--no Habitat experience is necessary! Spend a week helping build houses, and on your day off, explore the beautiful beaches (Pensacola) or take a drive to Disney World/Universal Studios (Lakeland). 

Get pumped for the chance to bring your passion for affordable housing to sunny Florida!

     Trip information:
     Dates: March 22-30, 2014
     Locations: Pensacola, FL and Lakeland, FL
     Cost: $230 (both trips)
          This covers ALL transportation and accommodations, and some meals.
