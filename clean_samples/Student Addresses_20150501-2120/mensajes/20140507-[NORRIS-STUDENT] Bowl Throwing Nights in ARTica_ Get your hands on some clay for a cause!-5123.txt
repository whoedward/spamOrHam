Hello all!

This Friday from 6 - 9pm, ARTica will be hosting the first of several Bowl Throwing Nights being held throughout the month of May to collect ceramic bowls as apart of the Empty Bowls Project, which is an international grassroots initiative to fight hunger. Become a part of the movement as we:

    Create and collect handcrafted bowls.

    Distribute the bowls in a cumulative event in exchange for a cash donation.

    Fill these empty bowls with soup for lunch.

    Forward all proceeds to Evanston and Chicagoland soup kitchens and food pantries.


Bowl Throwing Nights: Donate your time and join us in ARTica’s ceramic studio Friday nights from 6 - 9pm throughout the month of May (9th, 16th, and 23rd) to make bowls for the project. Open to all students and non-students. No ceramics experience required!


Bisqueware bowls purchased and painted during ARTica’s regular studio hours may also be donated to the Project.

Final Event Date: Bowls and soup will be available for purchase on Tuesday, June 3rd.

Any support would be much appreciated!
Thanks,
Bria
