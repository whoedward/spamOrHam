Hey all,

Here is the link to the meeting agenda for tomorrow.  For the new supers' info: I create this every week to make meetings go smoother.  If you have shift coverages or something you want to discuss with the group, please add it.

P.S. Don't forget to send a reminder about the meeting tomorrow with the location, for Yang or Will or whoever is doing that now.  I'm off to read about mental disorders for class.
