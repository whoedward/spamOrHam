Hello all!

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Carly Pablos, and I am the fundraising director for Julius Caesar!

One of the unique fundraising goals for the show is engaging the Evanston community. As such, the team and I have coordinated a holiday gift-wrapping fundraiser at the downtown Evanston Barnes and Noble for two days during reading week. The concept is that B&N shoppers bring their holiday purchases to the gift-wrapping station and we wrap their purchases for donations. We'll also be handing out quarter sheets to promote Julius Caesar and encouraging shoppers to head to the Jamba Juice fundraiser in order to be a friendly representation of the show and boost community engagement. 

This awesome fundraiser will be happening Tuesday, December 3rd, from 9 AM-4PM and Saturday, December 7th, from 9 AM-4 PM. The shifts are broken up into 30-minute time slots, and we are asking all of you to try to commit to at least an hour of gift-wrapping over the two days.

Please sign up with this google doc by Monday, December 2nd, at noon: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap7L5JYIub25dC0ySjJpZGlFcWNVMF8zQ21jUHJGc0E&usp=sharing.

Thank you all! Happy Thanksgiving and safe travels to those who are heading home tomorrow!

Carly
