Hi Michael, 

I can fill that out on shiftplanning this morning. Also, if people want I can fill out shiftplanning at the meetings from now on.

> Hey folks- I just looked at shift planning and no one is listed under the Ryan shifts.  Can we get the correct staff entered in ASAP.  I would prefer that you update all shifts at the meeting so the schedule is always up to date.  Since there are 7 of you one person could focus on filling out Shiftplanning while the meeting is occurring.
