Hey Supers,

Since there are so many shift trades and coverages going on at the moment, I decided to make a hard backup of every one we do each week.  I created an NTS shifts folder on Google Drive for the logs.  This link should work that you can see and edit things.  Let me know if there's a problem.

Also, someone should make a schedule on a Google Doc (if it hasn't been done already) so we have a backup too.  We can put that in there.

See you at the meeting tomorrow,
Christina
