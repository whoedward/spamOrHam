Hey Michael,

I'll be here this summer.  Most likely will be gone the first week, and then will have a part-time job downtown July-August.  I'd like to work some during that period, and as much as I can the rest of the time that I'm here.

Thanks,

Will

    I need to get a final count of folks who plan to work during the summer- can you let me know if you plan to be here?  If you havenâ€™t got summer paperwork filed- please do it this week.
