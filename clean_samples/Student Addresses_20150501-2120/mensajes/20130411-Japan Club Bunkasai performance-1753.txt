Hello everyone,

We have been invited to give a performance demonstrating what we do in the BJJ clup at the Japan Club's Bunkasai (cultural festival) on May 12th between 6 and 7pm (We won't be performing that long, but our performance will be in that time slot). Anyone that is interested in participating is welcome. Let me know if you are. We will showcase some Judo and BJJ techniques.

Peace,
Jacob
