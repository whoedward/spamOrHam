Hey guys,

I'll be starting the scavenger quest tomorrow, so go form/join a team! The prize is a $50 Visa gift card, and we have 5 teams right now. You can join later on in the week, but you will be at a large disadvantage against teams who already found the papers I will hide. So send me an e-mail with your team members by 9pm today!

Thomas
