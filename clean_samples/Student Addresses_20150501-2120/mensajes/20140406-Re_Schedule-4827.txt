Hi Kara,

Shiftplanning is being weird.. so refer back to the past week schedule (the first week of this quarter) to check when your shifts are!

    Hey Supervisors,

    So I just checked Shiftplanning and it says that the only shift I'm scheduled for is the Sunday 10 to Noon, when I thought I had the Sunday 10 to 2 and the Monday 6 to 8 (and Cont Ed 10:30 to 12). Was my schedule changed since the meeting or is Shiftplanning just being weird?
