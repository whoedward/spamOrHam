Hi NTS,

We're having our meeting tomorrow, from 7-8pm, in the Casbah Room. For you those of you who don't know where it is, it's Underground, in the Game Room, right next to the ping pong table.

If you can't make the meeting, please an email to the supers by midnight tonight with the reason why you cannot make it.

Thanks,

Alex
