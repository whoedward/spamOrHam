Hey lovely people!

Hope you had a great spring break everyone! I just wanted to let you guys know of a few things before we kick things off for the quarter.

1. We will have our FIRST open exec of this quarter in the main lounge at 8:30 this Sunday. Come by to see your new exec board and learn of what we have in store for this quarter. Plus, there will be candy to savor and cookies (made by yours truly :D) to devour!

2. We currently have 3 vacant positions on the exec board: Secretary, Philanthropy Chair, and Eco Chair. If you are planning on living here next year and have finished all of your housing stuff with Hannah, we encourage you to think about running for one of these positions. More information on this will be revealed in a few weeks.

That's all I have for now, have a wonderful weekend!

Thomas Lee
