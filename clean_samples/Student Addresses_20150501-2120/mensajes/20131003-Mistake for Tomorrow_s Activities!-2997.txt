Hey y'all!,

It seems I misspoke (mistyped?) and we'll be meeting in the lobby of ISRC at 4:45 to go over to the parade! If you plan on joining us you need to sign up on the form outside my door (room 116) to march in the parade. 

After that we'll still be going to Despicable Me 2 which will be hilarious and a great way to end your busy weeks :)

Can't wait to see you all there!,
Hali
