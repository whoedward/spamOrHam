Hello,

I just took another look at it, and am embarrassed to say that I did in fact misread the values for the j and k vectors. Apologies for the doubt.

    Hi Ethan,

    I just took another look, and the answer as posted seems correct to
    me.  I think you may have misread the given vectors.  Try checking the
    components of u: make sure you don't confuse the j and k vectors.
