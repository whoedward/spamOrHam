Hi NTS,

We're having our meeting tomorrow in the Chicago Room, from 7pm-8pm.

We're going to be going over Thanksgiving week shift coverages, so if you cannot make the meeting and need a shift covered, please reply so that we can get them covered during the meeting.

If you cannot make the meeting, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by midnight tonight.

Thanks,

Alex
