Ethan,

I'd rather keep my shifts, but we'll figure this out at the next NTS meeting. Till then, keep a look out for other people who have conflicts for their schedule. 

Thanks,
Andrew Jung

    I was looking over the schedule for this quarter, and I only have two shifts down. Because you have four listed (you're not the only one, but I happened to notice yours), I figured that you wouldn't mind passing one of those off. If it isn't much trouble, I can take your Saturday from 6-8 p.m. If, however, you prefer this shift, I am also willing to take your Wednesday from 2-4 p.m. Either one works well enough for me.

    Thanks,
    Ethan Robison
