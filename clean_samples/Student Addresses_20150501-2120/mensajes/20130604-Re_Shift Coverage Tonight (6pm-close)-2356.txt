        Hey guys,

        Can someone pickup this shift for me? I'm just now going to bed after an all-nighter (hopefully the last one of my college career!) and I have to attend classes later today and would love it if I could just come back and knock out. Let me know if you can help!

        Thanks,

        Fadhi
