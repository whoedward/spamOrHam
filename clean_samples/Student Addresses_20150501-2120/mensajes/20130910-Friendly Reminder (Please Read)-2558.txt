Hey All,

This is a just a cordial reminder about building sweeps and signing sheets.
Building sweeps, especially on closing shifts, have to cover the entire building (including McCormick and Louis), and need to check to make certain that mics and other valuable Tech equipment are put away at the end of every night.

Also, remember to sign off on sheets indicating who did what.

Best,
Ethan
