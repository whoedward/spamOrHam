Supes,

For those of you who haven't seen it yet, here's my t-shirt design.

The problem with it right now though is there are too many colors, which makes it pretty expensive to print. Also, I'm unsure of the quality of the images that I'm using. If it's alright, I'm going to reach out to some local print shops and see if they can give us a better price.
