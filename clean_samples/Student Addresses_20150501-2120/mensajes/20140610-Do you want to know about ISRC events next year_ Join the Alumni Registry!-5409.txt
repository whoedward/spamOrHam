Hey ISRC!

We want to make an alumni registry so we can contact you next year to inform you about all the alumni events we have. Since you won't be on the listserv anymore if you don't non-res or aren't coming back next year, we need your permission to be able to contact you next year.

Please fill out this form with your email and phone number (optional): https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1H5eQ3rxVQGwW57Vy3MOAx9vCw9W-xB8kATDXrf6prCo/viewform?usp=send_form

Thank you and have a great end to your finals week and have a wonderful summer!
