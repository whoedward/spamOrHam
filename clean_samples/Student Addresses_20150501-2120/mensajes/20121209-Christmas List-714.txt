Here are the links to the things which I would like for Christmas. If any of them are confusing or ambiguous, I can explain them more thoroughly.

(There is a store up in Greencastle that sells Redwing, according to the store locator)

I would also like $54 to cover my Aikido gi and $50 to cover my yellow belt test fees.

Thanks, Mom and Dad.
