Hey all,

This is just a quick reminder for everyone: For those who have not yet done so, please fill out your availability on Shiftplanning. For those that have, make sure that your availability covers only classes, meetings, labs, other jobs, or any other sort of recurring conflict. We'll try to schedule those who actually want shifts, but we need to know who might be available, so make sure that your availability is correct.

Have a great first day of class!
Best,

--
