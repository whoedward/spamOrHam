Hello, Wonderful Professors!

A small fact to which you might be privy: I was absent from class this morning. I do indeed have a draft of my poster as well as the missing second segment of the graphics homework. However, both exist in the real world (that is to say non-digitally). If you would like me to scan them and email them to you, I certainly can and will. Otherwise, please let me know how it is that I should ameliorate this rather significant problem.

Thank you very much,
Ethan Robison
