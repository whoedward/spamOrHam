Another thing guys!

Today we will end the practice a little early and have a brief MEETING afterwards to discuss the options for how to run the practices. I really encourage you guys to stay for the meeting and give us your feedback! Some of the senior members are thinking of changing the practice system to suit more members, so YOUR FEEDBACKS ARE CRUCIAL to us!

Hope you have a great start of the quarter!

Best,
Natalie
