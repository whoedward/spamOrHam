Hi everyone!

The Mental Health Student Group Coalition is polling the student body to gauge students' interest in implementing a peer-listening service. These data are crucial for allocating funds toward new mental health programming on campus.
Please take a couple minutes and fill this out!
 
ISRC-Love,

Nathan
