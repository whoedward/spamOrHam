Dear Ethan,

Earlier this year you received the UBPC’s Annual Survey, but declined to fill it out. We presented the Survey results to top University Administrators and received funding for the following priorities by respondents. If you would like more input in how the University spends its money be sure to fill out the Survey next fall!

•    Increasing the staff at CAPS
•    Expanding funding for NU Nights Programming
•    Creation of a Chicago Engagement Excursions fund
•    Increased funding of the NUnite Program
•    Funding for Faculty-Student Interaction grants
•    Funding for 2014 A&O Fall Blowout concert in Welsh-Ryan Arena
•    Increased funding of the Contemporary Thought Speaker Series
•    Expansion of need-based grants for student activities to include club sports
•    Continued Norris Center renovation efforts

We hope you are as excited about these results as we are and we hope to hear from you in the fall! For more details, please visit our website.

Best,

Chase Eck, Chair
Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee
Northwestern University
