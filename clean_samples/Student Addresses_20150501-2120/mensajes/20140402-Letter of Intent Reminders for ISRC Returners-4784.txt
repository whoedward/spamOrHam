Hey everyone,

For anyone who wants to live here next year, I just want to remind you that you need to give me your Letter of Intent form by this Friday at 9am. The Letter of Intent is attached, and you NEED this to secure your housing for next year at ISRC. Slide it under my door (room 304).

If I know you will be living here next year, I will personally remind you tomorrow afternoon-night just to make sure you are aware.

Thanks,
Thomas
