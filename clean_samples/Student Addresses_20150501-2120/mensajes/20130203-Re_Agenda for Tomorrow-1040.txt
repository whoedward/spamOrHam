Well we really couldn't make much of a RAM chart. Unless we wanted to get into the shop tomorrow there isn't any responsibility to allocate. We really would just talk about homework but there isn't any except reading and the web assign thingy thing that I assume is simple.

    It does seem like there isn't much to do. We can meet today, but it is also an option to not meet and wait until Tuesday. What do you guys think about that?

        Hey 4Loko,

        Assuming we're still meeting at 3 tomorrow, I'm not sure what we have to talk about. The syllabus is pretty much dead at this point and hasn't been updated.

        My best guess for topics to discuss:

        Web homework -- Check to see if everyone has done it or understands what to do (I myself may not fall in the latter category)  (10 min)

        Deliverables for Tuesday -- Are there any? Discuss. (5 min)

        Briefing on Status of Mockups Starting from Friday -- (5-10 min)

        Moving Forward -- (25-35 min approx, maybe less)
           Design preferences
           Mockup building schedule, at least for next week or so
           More RAM charts I guess

        Any suggestions from any of y'all: I'm stumped for much else and we need to talk about something.

        Best,
        Will Krinsman
