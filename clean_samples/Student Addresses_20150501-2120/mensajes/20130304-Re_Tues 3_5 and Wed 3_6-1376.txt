I am not sure if I will be back by 8 if I accept so I was wondering if either someone on the 6-8 shift would be willing to stay on until 8:30/whenever I can get there or if anyone wanted to cover my 8-10 shift. I am starting to run low on work study so I am fine with either option. If no one can it's not a big deal...I just like taking opportunities for free good food!
