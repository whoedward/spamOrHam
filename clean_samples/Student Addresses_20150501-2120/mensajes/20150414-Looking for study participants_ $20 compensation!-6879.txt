Hi!

I am recruiting participants for my study, and I would really appreciate if you could sign up! 
I am testing lost and found iPhone app.
You will be compensated with $20 Amazon gift card for downloading and using the app for one week.

You would have to 

    download the app, sign up, and let it run in the background during the 1-week study period.
    receive notifications about lost items that you will have to search for.

I am looking for people who:

    commute between Noyes and campus (for the train or lunch) everyday.
    have iPhone 5 or above

If you are interested, please sign up here by Wednesday (April 15).
I will contact you with more details. 

Please forward this to anyone who would be interested.

Thank you!

Best,
Yongsung
