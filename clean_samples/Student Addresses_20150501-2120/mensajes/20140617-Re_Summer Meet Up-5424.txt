I would be down for anytime in July, weekends only though, and I have to be able to get there by train or bus. Otherwise, I'm down for anything.

    The only for-sure commitment I have is in early July; I am, however, trying to get a job and trying to get to AZ at some point so you folks may have to go on without me. Transportation-wise, I'm all set. Keep me updated!
