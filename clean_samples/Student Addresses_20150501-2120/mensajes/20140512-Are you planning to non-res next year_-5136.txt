Hello ISRCers!

If you're not living in ISRC next year, you might be wondering "Hold on, how do I get my Munchies?" or "How do I get to read sassy bathroom notes?" and obviously "How do I still come use the awesome things we have at ISRC?"

Well, you can become a non-res at ISRC next year and it only costs $36!

To gauge the preliminary interest in non-res'ing to have an approximate number of how many non-res's we'll have next year, please fill out this form. It takes about 5 seconds:
