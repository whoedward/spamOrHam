Hey Jason,

Sorry to get this in so late. Things have been a thrill.

I spend a lot of my time working on personal programming projects, but I love to help others with theirs when I can. I'm looking to work on making McCormick advising better, and to make major decisions something more than just "guess and check."

My on-campus involvement is mostly just spending time with friends and working at the Norris Center as an A/V supervisor. I'm hoping to get more involved through MSAB and other groups.

Again, apologies.

Best,

    Hey guys,

    I have not yet received a picture of you for the website along with a blurb about your major, involvement on campus, and project interests.

    Please get this to me ASAP.

    Jason
