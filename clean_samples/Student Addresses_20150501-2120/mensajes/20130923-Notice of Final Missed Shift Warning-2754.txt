Hi Jake,

Last Thursday you were an hour and a half late to your opening shift despite multiple emails from Michael stressing the early open and the importance of the event. We have had previous instances in which we had to send along a warning to you as well. 

After discussing the issue amongst the supervisors and Michael, we are forced to issue you a final warning in order to prevent this from occurring again. Along with this warning you are being put on a 90-day probationary period. This means that any failure to meet your employee expectations during the 90-day period will result in immediate termination. 

I'll have to have you sign a form that states that you understand these terms. Please send me your availability for the week so that we can meet. 

I'd also like to stress that if there is ever an issue or conflict in the future please don't hesitate to reach out to the supervisors the moment it arises. We are more than willing to help out with any type of situation that may occur.

Regards,
Bobby Ramirez
