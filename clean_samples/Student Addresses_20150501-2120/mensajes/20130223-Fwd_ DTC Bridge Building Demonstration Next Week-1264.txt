William,

You can find videos of our last two competitions here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l3rd1uyco4e0w8b/yHZ1er7ZlZ).  I will see how badly the bridge is deformed to see if it is possible to construct part of it.

We feel it would also be in your competitive interest to have designs made which best reflect all parts of the competition they will be used for.
