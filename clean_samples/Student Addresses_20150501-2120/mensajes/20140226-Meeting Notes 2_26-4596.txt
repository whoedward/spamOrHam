Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from tonight's meeting

Announcements:

Please make sure you are properly initialing and putting the sheets back into the cubby in the office, don't leave them lying around the lab or in the hollow.

Mid-Term evaluations are due this Saturday, March 1st at 11pm. These are mandatory, and a super will sit down with you after you complete it to discuss it.

Make sure you are swiping out of shifts - if you miss a swipe make sure to email Michael with your name, the date of the shift and the length of the shift.

Please keep an eye on your work-study allotment. If you are getting close to your yearly allotment, make sure to contact the work-study office to see if you can get more.

If there are add-ons during a shift, make sure to get their information to either Michael/Dan during the day or Justin at night. This is to make sure that the clients are billed correctly for their equipment.

If you want to apply to be a supervisor next year, keep an eye out for information coming out about the Norris Leadership search. The process should start sometime in March/April.

Shift Logs

If you are doing an out-of-house event, you will need to complete a shift log after you are done with any part of that event. The shift log can be found here:
