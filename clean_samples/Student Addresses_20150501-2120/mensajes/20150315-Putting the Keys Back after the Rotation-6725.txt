I don't know which one of you it was, but note that when you are finished with the rotation (or any close), the regular keys and the day's sheets go up in the Louis Booth, the tech office keys should be returned to the center desk, and the walkie needs to be returned to the charge station in the Hollow.

Nobody is in trouble. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.

From,
Michael Wang
