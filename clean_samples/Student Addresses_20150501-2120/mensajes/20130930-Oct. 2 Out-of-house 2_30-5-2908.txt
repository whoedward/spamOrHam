Hey Supers,

I've spent the last half-hour going through schedules on our Google Doc and on ShiftPlanning.  The best I can figure it, here are the only people who might be able to take the shift (a.k.a. who didn't put they have a class or group).

Allegedly: John, Aliyah, and Magan are available after 3 PM; Juan is available after 4.

Ryan and Jolo are also available...and on shift.  Magan is scheduled for the 4-6, so he could come early and someone could have 4-5?  I'm not sure.

That's all I could gather and even then they may not be available.  Suggestions?

Thanks,
Christina
