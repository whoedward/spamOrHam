Hi All,

Just a reminder that there will be a fellows social from 4:00 to 6:00 in the Main Lounge today! There will be lots of gelato served in honor of the recently passed Republic Day in Italy! We're going to have Straciatella, Gianduja, and Frutti di Bosco. If like me, you're lazy and won't Google the meaning of those then come to the social and find out!
