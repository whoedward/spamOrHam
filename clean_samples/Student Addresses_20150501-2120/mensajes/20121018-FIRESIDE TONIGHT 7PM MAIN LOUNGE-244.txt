Hey West Fairchildren,

Just a reminder. Tonight, Prof. Andrew Roberts will give a talk about "How to Get the Most Out of Northwestern" at 7PM in the main lounge. Also, on Oct 22nd Monday, there will be CRC-ISRC Presidential Debate Gathering starting from 8PM in CRC main lounge. That will be the final Presidential Debate focusing on Foreign Policy. Prof. David Zarefsky, a dean of the School of Communication and one of the nationâ€™s leading experts on presidential rhetoric and debates, will lead a discussion afterwards.

Best,
Arkar
