Hey everyone,

This Saturday is the dress rehearsal for the KASA Show. Don't show up at Blomquist at 12 because none of us will be there (we won't be having our usual Saturday practice). Instead, please be at Tech Auditorium at 10 AM. Again, that's this Saturday, April 27th. We will not be carrying mats or anything. This will be primarily to learn our stage positions and transitions, so don't expect to break a sweat. The dress rehearsal will be an hour long at most.

If you are in the KASA Show demo, I expect you to be there this Saturday. This is the last demo practice, so no, you can not miss this one.

Ji-hoon
