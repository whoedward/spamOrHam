Hi all,

Wednesday is a notoriously bad evening for me.  Tonight I'll be downtown @ Catalyze participating in a crowdfunding event.  There are no changes to my shifts that I need -- I am willing to pick up some morning hours if someone needs covered this weekend.

​That said, my favorite cable is hands-down the dual RCA to 1/4th inch​.  MIDI takes a close second.

Best Regards,

Ahren
