Good morning all!

After eight and half years at NU, Jenn Stripe is putting in her last 7.5 hours today.  As payroll coordinator over the past 4 or so years, Jenn has kept Norris Student Employment running smoothly and efficiently.  She has set a very high bar in terms of her dedication to student employees and their development.  If you're in Norris today, please do stop by and wish her well in sunny California (Take us with you Jenn!).

Please be on the look out for emails regarding interim processes and procedures for payroll and other employment-related items.

For midyear evaluations...if you haven't turned them in already, please do so at the Cashier's Office.  We ask that you place them in a manila envelope to ensure that individual forms are not separated and lost.

Regards,

Norris Student Employment Committee
