Hi all,

This Saturday practice (tomorrow), we are going to end a bit early to clean the mats! We finally get to see with our eyes all the effort/sweat that we've put into TaeKwonDo by what comes off of those mats. 

SO, if you own a swiffer (or any kind of mop that can clean mats preferably with water) and some wet wipes for it, could you please PLEASE bring it to practice tomorrow? Let me know if you can bring one!

We will be working on KASA show demo at the beginning tomorrow, followed by individual practices, so people who are interested in being part of the demo should definitely come out!

Best,
Natalie
