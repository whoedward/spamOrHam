Hey guys!

This is our final project group.  Our first meeting is this Friday from 11-11:50 (regular class time).

For Friday, everyone should try to think of 2-3 ideas for the project.  Also, think about what programming experience you have, and what parts of a development you may be good at (overall planning, graphic design or a user interface, object-oriented development of multiple interacting classes, etc...)  

Our main goal these next two weeks is to get a good idea of what we want to create, and then start to plan out the development process as early and as thoroughly as we can.  This will get us a good head start and give us a lot of time to make a great final product. 


See you then.
