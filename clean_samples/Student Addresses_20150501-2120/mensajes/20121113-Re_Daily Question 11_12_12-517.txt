Hello Professor,

Sorry that I didn't manage to reply to your email in a timely fashion (I had classes until about 10:00 and didn't check my email until just now). If you would like to send me the picture, I can just send you my answer tomorrow.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    Hi Ethan,

    I apologize for not double-checking this earlier.  I should have sent
    you the picture when you asked (I confused this with a different daily
    Q that didn't have a picture).  If you've already attempted it and
    want to try again, let me know.

    Prof. Abrams
