That was totally my bad.  I couldn't remember what the policy was.  Thank you for clearing that up!

    We don't rent equipment to individuals, they need to be part of an Organization or department.  We can only charge organization accounts for equipment.   So next time they can either call 24 hours in advance to speak to me or buy what they need at the book store.

    Hi Michael,

    A client came asking if he could borrow a VGA + Mac Adaptor. I called Christina and gave him the equipment. 

    Name: Alex Diamond
    Group: QPR Training presented by CAPS at Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity House

    Phone: 7082562582

    Here is his information, if you need to charge or anything. He said he would have the equipment back by around 7~8.

    Thanks,
    Max
