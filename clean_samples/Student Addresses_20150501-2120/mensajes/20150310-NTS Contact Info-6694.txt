Hello!

Attached is a contact information spreadsheet I created.  Make sure you have, at the bare minimum, Chris's and the supers' numbers in your phone already.  Everyone else is on there in case you need to contact someone about shifts or other questions.  Keep it handy if you can.

Also, keep releasing shifts for Reading and Finals Weeks on Shiftplanning.  We are currently compiling a big list and the more we know ahead of time, the faster the meeting will go.

Best,
Christina
