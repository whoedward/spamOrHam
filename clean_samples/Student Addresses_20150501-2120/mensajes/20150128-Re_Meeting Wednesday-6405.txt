    Hey NTS,

    As a reminder, our meeting this week is mandatory for everyone - our new Tech Services Manager, Christopher Burpee, will be coming to the meeting. This means that unless you have a very good excuse (emergency/midterm) we will not be excusing anyone. Our meeting will be from 7-8pm in the Wildcat Room. If you cannot make the meeting, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason and release any shifts you need covered on Shiftplanning.

    Thanks,
