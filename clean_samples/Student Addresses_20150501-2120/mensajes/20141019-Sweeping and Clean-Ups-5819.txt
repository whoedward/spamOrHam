Hi All,

When we swept tonight (10/19/2014) we found an inordinate number of wee things about: mac adapters, presentation remotes, projectors on, etc. Please remember that, at all times of the day, these things are your responsibility, so try to clean them up as you pass through. It takes two seconds to grab a mac adapter from a room, but a heck of a lot longer to find one when they go missing because they were never cleaned up.

With that in mind, too, all of these things are cheap until they go missing. And it's a pain for Michael to have to clean up after our mistakes.

So be a little more thorough in your clean-ups and sweeps, please.

Regards,
