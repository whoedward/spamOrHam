Come to build
We need to go to Vertigo storage at some point, ideally either Friday or Saturday
Eva and Garrett also still need to get back to me about the stuff I emailed them (Russell can help)
List of things we need was sent out, let me know if you have things
TI can rent us everything we wanted from them for $45 for the week, pick up Monday @11, must be pulled by 12:15 - Can Russell come with me or write a check in advance?
Lost Eras is holding a water cooler and jug, $50 for the week, can get Monday
Seriously, come to build, it'll only be fun (think Dwarf Fortress, but don't tell them that)
Come see Bug
