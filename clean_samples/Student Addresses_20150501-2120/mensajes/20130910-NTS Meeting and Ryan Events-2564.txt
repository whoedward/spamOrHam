Hello!

My name is Christina and I am one of the NTS supervisors this year.  Our first meeting with all of the NTS staff will be on Friday, September 20 at 7 PM.  I don't believe the location has been confirmed yet, but it will be in a meeting room at Norris.  

Also, we can have your staff and ours meet at Ryan for events.  NTS staffers can pick up the key from Norris for now.

It'll be a pleasure working with you and your staff!  See you all on the 20th!

Sincerely, 
Christina
