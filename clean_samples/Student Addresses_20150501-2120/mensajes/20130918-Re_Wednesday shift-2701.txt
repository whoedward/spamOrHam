Hey Alex,

We appreciate your prompt response. Officially speaking, this email is to warn you that your absence counts as unexcused and has been recorded as such.
Unofficially, if you need any help with alarm clocks or some sort of a wake-up call, I'm sure that the other techs and I can come up with something feasible.

Regards,
Ethan

    Hey yall,
    I missed my shift this Wednesday morning at 8-10am.  Since having unpacked in my apartment I've realized that I forgot my alarm at home.  I've been using my phone but actually dropped it in a toilet yesterday and it is thus far non-functional.  This is probably less of a reason and more of an admission of being a moron, but I definitely wanted to let you all know.  I've got that situation figured out but unfortunately it did kind of mess up my schedule today.  Do let me know if I can make it up to you.  I can make balloon animal and have no sense of shame; feel free to be creative.  Thanks guys!
     
    Alex
