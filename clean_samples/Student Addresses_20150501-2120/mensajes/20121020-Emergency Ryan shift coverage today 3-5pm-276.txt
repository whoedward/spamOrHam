Hey all,

We haven't heard from everyone on the Ryan coverage from 2:45-5:00pm for the sound check. You could leave immediately after the sound check. We really need someone to step up and take this, it will not go unnoticed (think only being required to do one rotation, getting any shift covered by a supervisor, etc.) 

Thanks,
Tim
