Hi ISRCers!

We now have 2 more spots open for this November Cross RC trip to Shedd Aquarium on Sat., November 22 (estimated time commitment: campus departure 12:45 pm / return to campus by 5:45 pm)! If you are interested, please reply via e-mail or text me ASAP (314-537-4516) and drop off $10 at my office on the first floor of ISRC (envelopes are provided).

Our group experience at the Shedd Aquarium will include timed entry to their Aquatic show and 4-D Sea Monsters screening.  Our group will also be able to peruse any of the following exhibits: Waters of the World, Caribbean Reef, Amazon Rising, Wild Reef, Abbott Oceanarium, and Polar Play Zone.

Tickets are originally $18.25/person, but ISRC will offer subsidized tickets for $10. If anyone has issues with this payment, please feel free to e-mail me at jen.guo@u.northwestern.edu or Alec (ISRC Master) at alec-klein@northwestern.edu.

Best,

Jen
