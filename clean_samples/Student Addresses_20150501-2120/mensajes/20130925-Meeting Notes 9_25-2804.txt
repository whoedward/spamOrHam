Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from tonight's meeting

Make sure to check the schedule for changed shifts/remember to go to your new shifts, they're effective immediately.


We have a dress code this year - Norris t-shirts/Northwestern gear are required when you are on shift. If you haven't done so yet, make sure to get the Norris t-shirt from the marketing office on the 3rd floor as well as the Norris polo from Event management on the 3rd floor. We are also getting NTS shirts sometime.
