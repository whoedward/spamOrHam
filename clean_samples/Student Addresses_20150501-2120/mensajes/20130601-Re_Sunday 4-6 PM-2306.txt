Hey guys,
If someone could take this shift off my hands that would be great. An event that I was supposed to participate got moved up a couple of hours so it might interfere with this shift :/
If not it's fine, but I would definitely appreciate it.

                    Hey all,

                    So I know this is day after Dillo, buuuuut my friend is now coming to visit Sunday and we're going to probably be in the city all day.  Can anyone cover this in case we're not back on campus?

                    My eternal gratitude,
                    Christina
