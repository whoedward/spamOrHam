Alright. Now I'm going to take my time and finish the rest of what I was going to say. As Daniel put it, considering how we only had 1 sparring practice and pretty much no preparation for forms, we did really well. The next time a tournament comes around, we should be much more prepared, turn into pirates, and take everybody's gold.

As for those of you who are nervous about competing, this was Pius' first time competing at Purdue. He went to observe one year, saw the competition, and thought, "Hey, I think if I competed, I think I could win this." And he did. Next time, I hope to see a lot more of us going.

Anyways, we all had fun. I got kicked in the head three times in total, and one of those kicks must have been really really hard because apparently I left my uniform at Purdue but remembered my belt (thank goodness).

Videos of the tournament are coming soon. We'll upload them and share them with you guys as soon as we can. As for what's happening next, we might have a little club get together for those of us staying here for Thanksgiving. Something with lots of yummy food. Be excited. :)

See you all next practice (Monday)!
