Hey Ethan, 

Sorry, I totally should have noticed this earlier. 305 is actually a double, and I'm not allowed to assign one person to a two-person room. I know Ben Bailey (from my suite) is looking to have a roommate - let me know if you would be interested in rooming with him. 

If not, could you submit a different room preference? 321 is open, but I want to make sure you didn't have another room in mind. 

I need to know by Sunday night. Thanks! 

Hannah

    Hello Hannah,

    I am emailing in regards to room assignments for Fall quarter next year. My top three choices are 304, 305, and 321.

    Thanks again,
