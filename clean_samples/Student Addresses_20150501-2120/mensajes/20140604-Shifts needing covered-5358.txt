Hello.

I have released these on shift planning, but I will need this Thursday (tomorrow) from 6PM to 8PM covered and the following Thursday from 2PM until 4PM covered. 

I probably will not be able to come to tonight’s meeting. I have been running a fever of 103 and have nausea. I haven’t left my dorm in 3 days. 

Hopefully I feel better and can come, but no promises.

Also, if my symptoms persist through Thursday, I will not be able to work my other Thursday shifts. How should I handle this?

Thanks!
