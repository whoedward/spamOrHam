Hi NTS,

We're having our first meeting of the quarter tomorrow, from 7-8pm, in the Northwestern room.

We will be going over the schedule and address any conflicts, if you have any conflicts beforehand, send them over the listserv.

If you cannot make the meeting, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by midnight with your reason.

Thanks

Alex
