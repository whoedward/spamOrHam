Hey everyone, 

First of all, here is the link to this quarter's points list: http://bit.ly/UEzfy4 Remember - you need to be on 3rd list this quarter (and last quarter - hopefully you knew it) in order to be eligible to live in ISRC again. 

Second of all, I want to echo Emily and encourage you to take part in our online auction that is coming up on February 2nd. The entire Exec Board is doing it, and it would be great for the entire dorm to come together for a fun event and an excellent cause - raising money for our Dance Marathon team! We want to see at least three members from each suite participate (Exec members don't count!). If you need ideas, please talk to Emily or me - we would love to help you brainstorm. 

Lastly, we announced at our first Open Exec meeting last week that our social chair, Anthony, has resigned. Because Exec Board elections are coming up, we have decided not to have a separate election to fill the vacancy. If you have any questions or ideas about social events, please come to Tuesday night committee meetings at 7pm, or talk to any Exec members. 

And speaking of elections - winter is our last quarter as your Exec Board. =( We will be holding elections on February 17th. More information to come, but please consider running for a position - again, talk to any of us if you have questions. Remember that you need to be on 3rd list by election date in order to be eligible to run. 

Thanks for reading through! Hope your first two weeks have gone well! 

Hannah
