The Lure of MYSTERY FICTION:
From Victorian Escapism to Contemporary Social Critique
 
MONDAYS from 2 to 4:30 p.m. in Chapin
     
Instructor: Elżbieta Foeller-Pituch   efp@northwestern.edu
 
Distro Requirement: Area VI Literature and the Fine Arts
 
Why is mystery fiction (aka detective or crime fiction) such a popular genre, read across social strata and generating material for film and TV? How influential is it? What is the role of popular literature in contemporary culture?  To address these questions we will explore Anglo-American crime fiction as an example of popular literature that has expanded globally and developed from an escapist genre to a vehicle of contestation and social critique.

This course traces the spectacular rise of detective fiction from E.A. Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to contemporary writers, examining the historical and social conditions for the emergence and development of the popular genre (urbanization of Europe and America; rise of the British Empire; importance of the inter-war period; Cold War, etc.). This will allow us to discuss the structure and evolution of formula fiction and its role in popular and high culture, its reflection of the preoccupations of Western societies, and the ways in which canonical writers have used elements of mystery fiction in their own literature.
 
Readings will be selected from the following:
Edgar Allen Poe, selected stories (1845); Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone (1868); Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, selected stories (1890s); Agatha Christie, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926); Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep (1939); Thomas Pynchon,The Crying of Lot 49 (1966); Tony Hillerman, Listening Woman (1978) or Talking God (1989); Tim O’Brien, In the Lake of the Woods (1994); Kate Atkinson, Case Histories (2004); selected stories from Libby Fischer Hellmann, ed. Chicago Blues (2007); secondary source: John Scaggs, Crime Fiction (Critical Idiom series, Routledge, 2005). Some short stories and secondary sources (essays and scholarly articles) will be provided online or as photocopies.
