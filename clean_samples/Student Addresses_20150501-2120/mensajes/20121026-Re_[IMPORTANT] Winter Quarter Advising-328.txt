Hello Dr. You,

I was under the impression that we were to meet at a different time. Fortunately, I can meet at about 2:40 p.m. today (although I will be slightly rushed, as I have a midterm at 3:00). I will see you then.

Regards,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan,

    It seems that we are scheduled to meet 11:20-11:40AM. Are you still coming or would you like to reschedule the meeting? To reschedule, can you pick a 20-min slot from the following time intervals?

    1:40-2:00pm, today
    2:40-3:00pm, today

    Please let me know if any of them work for you.

    Best regards,

    Fengqi You

            Dear Advisees,

            I hope things are going on well with your fall quarter and you are
            enjoying the life at Northwestern. As the registration of the winter
            quarter will begin in November, we will have the winter quarter
            registration advising later this month. In addition to discussing the
            courses to take in the winter, we also need to fill the Study Plan
            (the "pink sheet"), which is required before you register for the
            winter quarter.

            The McCormick-wide schedule for the advising will be on the week of
            Oct. 29 - Nov. 2. Unfortunately, I'll be out of town for attending the
            AIChE Annual Meeting on that week (most professors in the ChBE
            department will attend that conference, as AIChE is the umbrella
            organization for chemical engineers).

            To ensure that you can register for the winter quarter on time, it
            would be better for us to meet before that week. Some time on
            Thursday, Oct. 25, or on Friday, Oct. 26, would work best for me. I
            have set up a Doodle and it can be accessed from the link below:

            http://www.doodle.com/kkf5nura3gcm3bv5

            Please fill it at your earliest convenience. Please note that all the
            slots are "first-come, first-served".

            I look forward to seeing you again in a couple of weeks.

            Best regards,

            Fengqi You
