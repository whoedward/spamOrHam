Hi all,
This e-mail is just to notify all basketball players that there will be no game tomorrow. We have a bye week. We'll pick back up next Monday, 2/2, against PARC/CCS.

There will be Floor Hockey at 8:30 this Thursday against CCS/PARC/Jones/Shepherd/Willard. Please meet in the main lounge at 8:00 and please wear black. I'll send out another e-mail later to remind you all.

Thanks, happy almost Monday,
Paul Kim
