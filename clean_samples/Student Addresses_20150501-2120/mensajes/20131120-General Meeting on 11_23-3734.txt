Hey, guys,

One other thing that I wanted to mention. With the tournament test coming up and the quarter coming to an end, I felt like it would be good to have a meeting to discuss how this tournament test would and should be run as well as certain plans for next quarter. Everyone is welcome to offer their input on these matters, so don't hesitate to come out. I was thinking of meeting this Saturday in the morning for brunch around 10:45 A.M. or so at Le Peep. If there are any objections to that, please do let me know. Also, let me know if you will be coming to this meeting, so that we can plan accordingly.

TL;DR: we're going to try to finalize the details of the tournament test and discuss plans for next quarter. This Saturday, 10:45 A.M. at Le Peep. Let me know if you're coming.

Thanks,
Davin
