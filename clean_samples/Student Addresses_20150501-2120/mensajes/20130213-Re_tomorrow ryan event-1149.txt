UPDATE:  no Tech equipment was needed at all according to the Professor--he said that whoever made the reservation for him may have made a mistake and forgot to check off "No tech needed," or something like that.

TO SUM:  No techs needed to cover this shift!

Thanks again,

Marina

    Hey all!

    I headed to Ryan as soon as my class got out at 4:50, and when I spoke to the Professor or TA, he said that they were all good with Tech equipment--and as far as I observed, there wasn't anything besides the use of the Resident Computer.  So no worries!  I think all someone will have to do is make sure everything is turned off after the end of the exam, circa 8:30 pm by his words.

    Thanks everybody for coming together!

>>                         Phoebe is not feeling well .  She has stepped up many times to cover shifts.  Let’s do her a solid and cover this for her.  We can even split it into a few shifts.  5-7, 7-9 or 5-6:30-7:30-9?  That would give both techs time to eat some pizza!
