    Hey everyone,

    Michael Wang created this fantastic trouble shooting document for Smart Rooms.  Please look it over and let me know if you have any suggestions.  I will put a copy in Sharepoint if you want to edit it.  You can also edit this one and send it back to me.  We will put this document in all the stacks.

     

    Michael
