Hey Jolo,

I just wanted to check to make sure that you were aware that you were signed up for the Continuing Ed Tech shift from 12-2 on Thursdays. If there is a misunderstanding, please let us know ASAP.

Otherwise, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com promptly with a reason as to why you missed this shift.

Regards,
Ethan Robison
