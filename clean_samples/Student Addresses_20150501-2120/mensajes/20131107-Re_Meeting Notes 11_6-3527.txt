            Hi everyone,

            Here are the notes from tonight's meeting

            Announcements:

            Tier one training needs to be done by Nov 15th. It's very easy, just setting up a smart room and conference phone. You can do this when you are on shift with a supervisor or during any of our office hours.

            The last session of group training will be taking place this Saturday, from 9am-12pm. There will be breakfast served. People who have not done a session yet are:

            Joyce, Angela, Max Z., Will W., Aliyah, Max G., Braelyn, Kara, Jake, Juan, Nelson, Jolo, Alex S

            You will need to either come to the upcoming session or schedule one independently with the supervisors.

            Please make sure you are swiping in and out of shifts - if you miss a shift, you can email Michael, but you have to give him your name, date and time of the shift.

            There is a shift that was missed during the meeting - McCormick needs an extra tech from 4:30-8pm on Sunday. Even if you cannot take the shift, please reply back so we know that you are aware of this shift.
