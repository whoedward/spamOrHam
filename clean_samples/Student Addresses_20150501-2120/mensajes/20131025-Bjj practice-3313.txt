Hi everyone!

Two things.

First, many people said they would like to practice during the week, so we will work on finding a time for that.

Second, we will still be having practice this Sunday, 11am-1pm at Blomquist!
If you haven't come yet, you are still welcome! We will be reviewing stuff from last week as well as going over some awesome new stuff which I haven't decided on yet.
