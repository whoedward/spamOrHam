    Hey everyone,

    I know it's the middle of finals week, and everyone's got a lot on their plates, but would it be possible for somebody to cover my 10-midnight shift tonight?  I've got one final 7-9pm tonight and then another 9-11am tomorrow morning which I haven't even begun to prepare for; I could really use the extra study time.

    Thanks,

    Ryan
