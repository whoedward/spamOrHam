Hey everyone,

As you may have seen, NU AIChE is organizing a brewery tour next weekend. We are ALSO organizing a distillery tour (which is different than a brewery tour) with a yet undecided date. So if you are interested, please fill out the Doodle Poll below to choose the date.

Please note that there is no time listed. Ideally it would be in the afternoon on the chosen day because that is when they are actually distilling things. So if you are interested, please choose whatever days work for you IN THE AFTERNOON. Thanks!

Also, the earlier the date, the better if you have no preference on the week.

Thanks again,
