Hi Everyone,

We will go ahead and have practice tomorrow with the guy coming to teach.

Hope to see you all there, it should be good!

    Hi Everyone,

    Sean has made a good point. Please RSVP if you will come to BJJ tomorrow. If we don't have enough people I will postpone the guy coming to teach. (If you didn't read my last email, a guy offered to come teach a class for us to see if we want to start having a professional teacher).
