I think we got something mixed up.  I told you guys I had covered a shift by Chen the week before, but I never said I would take it.  I guess there was a miscommunication or something.

    Hey Alex,
    The supers conferred and all indicators show that you took the shift on Sunday, as it is in our meeting notes, and Christina believes that you took it at the meeting from Chen. 
    Do you know what might have happened? We saw that you sent an email saying that you thought you were not on that shift 45 minutes before the shift began. It was on shiftplanning since Thursday. 

    Will
