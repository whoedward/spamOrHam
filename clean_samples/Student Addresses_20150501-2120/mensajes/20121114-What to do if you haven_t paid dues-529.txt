Hello everyone,

For those of you who haven't paid dues, I just wanted to let you guys know that due to an unfortunate series of scheduling conflicts, I won't be at practice this entire week.  Fear not though!  You can give any unpaid dues to either Ji-hoon or Kelly.  If you're paying with check and it has your name on it, great.  If you're paying with cash, if you can, put a sticky note or something on it with your name and/or text me at 618-316-3961 and just give me a heads up that you've paid.

Thanks!

Allan
