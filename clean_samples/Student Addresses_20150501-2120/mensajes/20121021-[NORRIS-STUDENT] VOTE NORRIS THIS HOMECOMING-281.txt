As some of you may know, two of our very own FABULOUS Norris employees are on homecoming court this year! Show your love and support for CM Yando Lopez and Housestaffer Kyra Woods by voting for them here: http://tinyurl.com/99nm3pq 

REP NORRIS. Show everyone how cool we are. Vote early, vote often (meaning vote now, you can also only do it once)! TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

Norris Love,
Meredith
