Hey ISRCers,

Tonight, as the final IFN of this quarter, we are going to watch "Joyeux Noel", a beautiful French movie about the World War I Christmas truce. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Film for the 2005 Academy Award and the 2005 Golden Globe. So take a break from your study and enjoy the film with us at 8PM in the basement !

See you then,
Arkar

P.S. There will be no Academic and Social Committee meeting tonight.
