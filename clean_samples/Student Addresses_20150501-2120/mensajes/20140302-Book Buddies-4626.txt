Hi everyone,

Welcome to another week of volunteering with Jumpstart NU! 

Here are some fun, low-commitment opportunities that we will be hosting soon. All spots are first come, first served, so hit 'REPLY' asap!

 

Book Buddies at the Evanston Public Library

1703 Orrington Ave, Evanston IL

Weekly (Fridays) 3:30pm-5pm. 

 Join us at the Evanston Public Library children's area at 3:30pm to read to kids for an afternoon! You'll receive a brief orientation about reading strategies with young children. Then there will be group story time and after that you'll get to read in small groups with your book buddies! The afternoon will end with an activity that relates to the theme of the week. Email me, Diamanta Panford, (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) to reserve your spot!


Spots available for March 14th and 21st 

Unfortunately there are no spots available for March 7th however we are looking for volunteers for March 14th and March 21st. March 21st is the last day of the quarter and we will also be celebrating Mr. Rick (the children's librarian)'s last day.


Best,
