Then check out ISRC's online people auction!
 
Only 24 hours left until the auction closes!
 
Up for auction are foods ranging from a three-course Chinese dinner to dumplings to scones.  There are music lessons ranging from the violin to the mountain dulcimer to beatboxing.  There's everything from a Korean lesson to video game codes and manicures to grocery delivery. 
 
Check out the auction page here:  http://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction.  All you have to do is "like" the page and click through the photo album.  Comment on the photos to place your bids.  It's all in support of ISRC's DM team.
 
By the way, it's important to note that the suggested starting bids are just that:  suggestions.  If you see something you want, you can start the bidding at whatever you like as long as it's at least a dollar.  Bidding goes up in increments of one dollar each time.
 
Also, we are currently about two-thirds of the way to the $300 needed for us to pie our master, Alec Klein, in the face!  You should know that at the last closed exec meeting, he said that his face felt "very unthreatened from pie."  Prove him wrong, ISRC!
 
Feel free to e-mail me with any questions.
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
