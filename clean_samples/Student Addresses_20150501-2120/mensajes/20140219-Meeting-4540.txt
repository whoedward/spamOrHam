Hi,

I can't make the meeting tonight because my professor is taking my class downtown to watch a concert (we planned for this several months in advance).

I won't be available at all on Friday because I'll most likely be in the city.
I'll be free on Saturday morning (I picked up the 12-2PM shift on Saturday), and if no one wants the Saturday close, I can take that too.

Thank you,
--
