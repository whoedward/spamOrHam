Hey guys,

I don't have a conflict for this time or anything, but if anyone wants some extra hours, you can have them from 4-6pm today. Very simple shift. 

Basically, a series of unfortunate events has left me behind on homework and in need of stress-free couch-lounging/Masters-watching time. Again, not necessary at all, but it would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Tim
