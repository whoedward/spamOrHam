Hi all.

I have corrected a small typo in MP2 solutions, so it should work fine now.

Specifically there was a line:

iSeg = iSeg++;

in one of the versions of the solutions posted.

Also, VS users should use this line: (otherwise the last character is chopped)

int len = (int)strlen(Buffer);

while XCode users should use this line:

int len = (int)strlen(Buffer)-1;

These are the only differences between the new solutions posted.

Reminder: Both these solutions assume your input file to be names TestCases.txt.

Also these solutions may be more primitive than you have expected, so you are free to do any upgrades you want.

Also these solutions cannot handle the spaces at the end of a line, so you can assume there will be no spaces at the end of a line for the test cases.Reminder: If you have any program that works correctly, you can use it. You are NOT required to use MP2 solution. However if you do not have a properly working solution to MP2, then you can use the solution provided and make any changes on it.
