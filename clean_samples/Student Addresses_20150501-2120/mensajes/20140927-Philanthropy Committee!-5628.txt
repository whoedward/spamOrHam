Hello ISRC!

I hope your first week of classes has been wonderful! Thanks to all of you who went to Cheesie's and helped with our first Dance Marathon fundraiser! Now I'm hoping you all will want to help plan future fundraisers and service projects. If you are interested in participating in DM, volunteering in the Northwestern and Evanston communities, or becoming more involved in the workings of ISRC please consider joining the philanthropy committee :) 
We will meet once a week in the main lounge for about 10-20 minutes, so it's not a big time commitment. I plan to hold our first meeting right after open exec tomorrow night, 8:30 in the main lounge. Please email me if you are interested! Oh, and did I mention you will receive half a committee point for each meeting you attend? :) I hope to see you all tomorrow at open exec!

ISRClove,

Ellen
