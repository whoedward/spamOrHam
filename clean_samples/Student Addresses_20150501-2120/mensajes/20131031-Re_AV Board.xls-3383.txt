Hello,

My apologies that the Ryan shifts aren't on Shift Planner yet; this will be remedied this afternoon.  The Techs working Saturday are the following:

Joyce Lee 9 AM-11:30 AM
Aliyah Lee 11:30 AM - 1 PM
Max Zhang 1 PM - 3:30 PM
Max Gillet 3:30 PM - 5 PM
Kara Craig 5 PM - 7 PM
Juan Herrera 7 PM - 11:30 PM

If you would like Coren to wait until 1 PM, we can let Max Z. know to wait for him at Norris.  Or he can go to Ryan at 12:30 and just have to meet Aliyah there.  It is up to you.

Let us know if you have any other concerns!
Sincerely, 
Christina

    Can you tell me who from your staff is working Ryan this Saturday?  From my staff I have Connor Smith working 9:30a – 12:30p, and Coren Warden working 12:30p – 5p.  I’d like to have Connor meet your staff member at Norris and walk over.  Since you/Conner will already be there when Coren’s shift starts, I’ll just have him go directly to Ryan.

     

    Best,

    Pete

    I’ll be in touch Thursday to see who from your staff is scheduled for that week’s Ryan shifts and connect my staff with you to meet at the info desk.

    Best,

    Pete

    Reminder- For Ryan Shifts- meet the Satellite Venue folks at the info desk.   Walk over to Ryan together- have them turn on the system- let them interact with the client.  We will be transferring Ryan duties in the near future so we need to get Pete’s folks trained.

     

    Pete if you have anything to add please do so..
