Hey guys,

So...I know we normally have our bible studies on Thursday ~2:30, but I know that 2:30 isn't a great time for some of you this coming week so I was wondering what alternative time would work better for you guys. I think we may have mentioned 5:00 PM instead, but I just wanted to know what your availabilities looked like. 

Let me know!
