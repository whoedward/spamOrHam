Hi everyone,
This e-mail is just to remind you that there is going to be a cookout tomorrow, Monday, June 2nd, at 6:00 PM, in the ISRC/CRC lawns. There will be hamburgers, hotdogs, pop, chips, and games.

If anybody can meet me at 4 in the lobby tomorrow to help me get the equipment, please e-mail me back. I'd need about 6 people to help.

If anybody would like to help grill, please e-mail me. I need as many people as possible, so if you are interested please let me know. We would meet at 5:30 in the lobby and then head out to the lawns to set up/start grilling.

Thanks so much. See you all tomorrow.
Paul Kim
