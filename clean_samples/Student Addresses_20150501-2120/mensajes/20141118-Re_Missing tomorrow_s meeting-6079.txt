    Hiya super-dee-dupers,

    Tomorrow night at the same time as our meeting, I have quarterfinals for IM volleyball. Is it alright if I miss the meeting? Last time I said I couldn't come because of a presentation, but that was rescheduled so I was able to go to the meeting last week after all (and I did go, like the responsible human being that I am!). IN OTHER WORDS I HAVEN'T MISSED A MEETING YET, PLEASE LET ME GO <3

    Your favorite employee,
    Didi
