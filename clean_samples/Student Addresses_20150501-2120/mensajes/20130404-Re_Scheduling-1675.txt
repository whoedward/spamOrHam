Dr. You,

I am taking DTC part 2, EA IV (honors), EA III (regular), Introduction to Career Development, and a seminar on Language and journalism. However, career development and the seminar are both once a week classes. Career Development is also not worth any units of credit.
Do you have any recommendations? I do have four units worth of classes, but I also have a very light schedule. Obviously, this is not a bad thing; however, I am more than willing to add in some other requirement or useful class.

Thanks,
Ethan

    Ethan,

    I think it is fine to drop Organic Chem. Which other courses are you taking?

        Hello Dr. You,

        I am Ethan Robison, one of your freshman advisees. I am emailing you in
        regards to my Spring quarter schedule. Because I do not need the third
        part of organic chemistry, I am considering dropping the class. However,
        I wanted to check with you both to see if this would be okay and to ask
        if there are any classes that you would recommend that I take in its
        place. If there is anything that I can do to help you with this, please
        let me know.

        Thanks,
        Ethan Robison
