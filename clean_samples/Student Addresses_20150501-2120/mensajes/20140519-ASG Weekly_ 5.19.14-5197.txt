ASG Faculty and Administrator Honor Roll

Each year ASG presents the opportunity for students to honor faculty and administrators who consistently and excitedly enrich our time here and represent a commitment to the Northwestern student body. This process has impact reaching far-beyond ASG, including hiring, promotion along the tenure track, and consideration for other university staff and faculty awards and nominations. Please take this opportunity to recognize those who have served Northwestern University with distinction by voting for the faculty members that you believe represent these ideals!

Please nominate faculty and administrators by May 23: https://northwestern.collegiatelink.net/form/start/44105

If you have questions, concerns, comments, or suggestions, please contact Anna Rennich, ASG VP for Academics, at asg-academic@u.northwestern.edu.

You will then be able to use this licensed software for as long as you are an active student at Northwestern.

Office 365 apps for Android or iPad should be installed following the specific instructions provided on that device.

Sign up for ReNUvation!

Every year ASG organizes a neighborhood cleanup of the streets immediately west of campus the morning after Dillo Day. After a fun day of celebrating, this is students' chance to give back to the Evanston community and take responsibility for making sure all the leftover Dillo trash is disposed of.

The more volunteers we have, the quicker we'll be able to leave the neighborhood as we left it. We'll be meeting at 9am on 6/1 outside Kellogg. Gloves, garbage bags, and bagels will all be provided! Please sign up to volunteer here!

Take the Shop-n-Ride Survey!

Do you take the Shop-n-Ride shuttle to shop off campus?
Ever want to run errands but don't have transportation?
Want to help decide where the Shop-n-Ride could take you?

Take this Shop-n-Ride survey and help us plan next year's route!

Find Work on JobCat!

JobCat connects busy Evanston residents with Northwestern students who want to help. From babysitting to administrative work, JobCat is a great way to get involved in the Evanston community and make some money in the process.
