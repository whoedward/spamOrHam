Hey all,

We now have a phone list. I think this is not yet complete so if you dont see your name on the phone list, please send me your numbah ;). 

The phone list is in the 3rd tab on the schedule google doc, so book marking the google doc might be a good idea :D

Heres the link!!

Also, make sure you know who is on shift with you, before you and after you. It just makes life easier.

Toodles,
Andrew Jung
