Hi Linda,

To start, everything is going well here, thank you.

The dishes and kitchen items are not necessary, so PLEASE leave those behind.

However, the Magic Bullet is okay.

The microwave is more than okay, please bring that.

The couch is okay.

The Lazyboy is probably okay, unless it is a rather large affair. Could you email us a picture, please?

The bookshelves should be okay, although it might be best to bring only two of them (either two of one kind or one of each works fine); there isn't much space for extra shelving in the apartment.

Carpets should be good to go.

Hopefully that covers everything. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Address is:
2213 Ridge Avenue Apt. 2B
Evanston, IL 60201

Best,
Ethan & Co.

    Hi Ethan,
     
    I just want to confirm plans for this weekend.  A U-Haul has been reserved.  We expect to arrive at your apartment between 1:00 and 3:00pm Saturday (09/27).  In addition to items for Jonas's bedroom, delivery includes two 3' by 6' and two 1' by 6' bookshelves, loveseat-sized sofa, microwave, Magic Bullet, complete set of dishes, Lazyboy chair, two small carpets as well as various kitchen items.  Let us know if any of the listed items is not needed.  Would hate to haul it up and learn there is no room or you have duplicates.  We will be returning U-Haul in Evanston and taking Megabus home.  There is no option for our going home with anything but suitcases.
     
    I will also need the address.  I don't think Jonas ever passed it on.
     
    Hoping first days of classes are going well.  Looking forward to meeting up.
     
    Sincerely, Linda
