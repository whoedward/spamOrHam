    Hi Frank,

    Sure no problem. You got the last ticket. If you're coming to the ISRC Halloween party, you can give me the money then. 

    Best,
    Esteban

            Hi ISRC,

            Two important announcements:

            1.) RCB Formal ticket sales end TONIGHT at midnight! There are only a few left, so please let me know if you want to buy one. Also, if for some reason you can no longer attend the formal and already brought a ticket, please let me know by TONIGHT as well. 

            2.) RCB is hosting a trip to go to Second City!! The trip is on Sat. November 22nd. The show is at 8pm, so we will leave sometime between 6-7pm (exact details tbd). The tickets to this are FREE, however ISRC only has SIX tickets for this trip. I will send out a google form at 6pm tomorrow. The first six to respond will get the tickets. 

            Any questions please let me know. 

            Best,
            Esteban
