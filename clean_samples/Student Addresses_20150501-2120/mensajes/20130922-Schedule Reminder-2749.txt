Hi everyone,

Just as a reminder, we are going on our new schedule starting tomorrow.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdHRibVR4TzJZZHdEMTU0V2Uwd3JhX0E&usp=sharing

There have been a few revisions made, so make sure to check to see if your shift has changed.

As usual, if you any complaints/conflicts with the schedule, email me ASAP.

Also, if you have not signed on to Shiftplanning and checked it out, make sure to do so.

Once you're on Shiftplanning, make sure to change your notification options through the Profile -> notifications page. Unless you want to get an email/text 24 hours and 60 minutes before every shift, make sure to do this.

Here's the link if you need it:

Thanks,
