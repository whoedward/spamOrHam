Hello, lovely ISRC-ers!

I hope you all had great breaks and are staying safe and warm.  I know that not all of you are back on campus, but I hope you get here soon, without too much more frustration!  See below for information on getting a philanthropy point for doing Book Buddies THIS FRIDAY.  Email Diamanta Panford (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) and CC me if you'd like to participate! 

ISRC-love,
Ayla

Hi everyone,


Welcome to another quarter of volunteering with Jumpstart! Book Buddies will be resuming this Friday 01/10. If you would like to volunteer, please email me asap as spots will be going soon!


Book Buddies at the Evanston Public Library

1703 Orrington Ave, Evanston IL

Weekly (Fridays) 3:30pm-5pm. Available THIS Friday 01/10!

 Join us at the Evanston Public Library children's area at 3:30pm to read to kids for an afternoon! You'll receive a brief orientation about reading strategies with young children. Then there will be group story time and after that you'll get to read in small groups with your book buddies! The afternoon will end with an activity that relates to the theme of the week. Email me, Diamanta Panford, (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) to reserve your spot!
