Hi Everyone, 

This is on shift planning as well, but I'd appreciate it if someone could cover my Wednesday open this week. It's going to be a really late night for me and I'd like to try and catch up on some sleep if possible tomorrow night. It's not a total emergency but if someone would be willing to take the shift for me I'd be really grateful. Thanks!
