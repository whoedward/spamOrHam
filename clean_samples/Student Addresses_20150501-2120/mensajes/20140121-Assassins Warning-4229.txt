Hey everyone,

I just want to let everyone know about one final thing about assassins. If you do not pick up a water pistol from me AND you do not answer the questions in the rules by Saturday noon, I will take your name off of the game and continue with everyone who followed through. This game has been pushed back far enough, so that's why I'm doing this.

Thanks,
Thomas
