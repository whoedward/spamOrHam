Hi everyone!

I am going to an event on Sunday out of town and am unsure if I'll make it back in time to cover these shifts. Can someone take them off my hands? Its a really easy two shifts because theres usually NOTHING going on and you can just chill and do homework or something. I'd really appreciate it! Thanks! Of course, I'd be willing to cover one or two of your shifts in the future if my schedule permits!

Best,
