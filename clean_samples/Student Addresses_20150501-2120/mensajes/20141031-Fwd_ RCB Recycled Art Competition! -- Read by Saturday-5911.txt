Hey, everyone! 

RCB is hosting a recycled art competition! ISRC is making a collaborative art piece out of recyclable materials, which will be due November 7th. You don't have to be an experienced artist to participate. Heck, you don't have to be an artist at all. The more of us who do it, the more fun it'll be!

Take a look at the rules and the "inspirations" included in this email and think about what you'd like ISRC to do for our project. I'll put a Facebook poll out this weekend to see which ideas are most popular. On Sunday, I'll be working on this project
​ from 7:00pm onward in the main lounge. ​
​

Although I'm attaching the rules to this email, below is the tl;dr version. 

-Each RC is a team
-Any resident may help
-No size limit
-MUST be made from recycle materials (exceptions are tape/wire)
-Artwork must be able to come apart and be recycled
-There must be an explanation of the artwork
-Keep artwork PG-13
-Have until Nov. 7th to complete art piece

Here are examples of two artists who create art that respond/interact with the environment; one promotes growth while the other deals directly with waste in relation to animals:

​Thank you, 
Your Eco
