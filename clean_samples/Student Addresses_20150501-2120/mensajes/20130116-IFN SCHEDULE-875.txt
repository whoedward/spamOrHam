Hey Best Fairchildren,  

Thanks for filling out the doodle. In this quarter, instead of taking place on same night each week, IFNs will rotate around Thursday, Friday and Saturday. For this week, we will start from Friday. 

On Friday at 8PM in the basement, we are going to watch a Bollywood epic film called "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India". This musical drama has garnered critical claims and was nominated for the Academy Award in 2001. Beside, Lagaan is one of the 25 best sport movies listed by Time magazine. So come enjoy this awesome movie and get academic points ! 

Best,
Arkar
