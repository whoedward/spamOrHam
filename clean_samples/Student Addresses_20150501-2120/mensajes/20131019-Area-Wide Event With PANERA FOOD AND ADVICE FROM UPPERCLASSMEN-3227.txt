Hey!

So we're throwing an area-wide event called "I Wish I Knew Then..." which focuses on giving freshmen advice that they might not realize they need! We've garnered at least one person from each of Northwestern's six schools there to give advice! We are having the event this upcoming Sunday, tomorrow at 12:30 in the Hinman TV lounge with catering from Panera. Now you don't have to walk all the way to Allison to get food! Please get back to me with your interest! Thanks!

Hope to see you tomorrow!,
Lovely CAs
