Jenn,

Can we pick up our keys at midnight then? I would like to change bus tickets (because of Tech training that I did not plan for) but that means I'll be arriving late.

I know a couple people arranged for friends to pick up keys but that is no longer needed, as your Wildcard will be required to show the desk attendant to pick up your keys.
