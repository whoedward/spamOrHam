Hello Michael,

Yesterday (4/4/13) at the Fisk event we had set up a pair of powered speakers to help the performers be heard. However, one of the JBLs was left out of the setup because of its tendency to produce horrible feedback (the slightest amount of sound to the speaker caused ear-splitting wailing).

Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to see exactly which of the two was the problem, but I do believe that one of the speakers has a square of white tape in the corner of its front face. This is the speaker that works. The speaker that does not work is the one without the square of tape.

Hopefully this is clear enough, but I can absolutely help to clear things up.

Thanks,
Ethan
