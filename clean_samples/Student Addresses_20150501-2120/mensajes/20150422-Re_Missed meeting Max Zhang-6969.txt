    Hi Max,

    Since meetings are required for NTS, the supers agree that your excuse is an unexcused absence for today.

        Hi supervisors,

        I will not be in attendance tonight because I will be getting dinner with my class. Thank you. I have nothing to release or cover. 

        Best,
        Max
