Hello Alex,

I apologize that this email is a little late (I have no access to a computer and I had class, to make a long story short), but I have to go to the orientation at Norris tonight at 6:30 p.m. Apparently, it lasts about an hour, so I should be able to catch the tail end of the meeting. Is this alright?

Ethan

    Hi NTS,

    We are having our meeting tomorrow, from 7-8pm somewhere. I will send out an email as soon as I find out where it is, but if you cannot make the meeting, please send in your reason by 12pm tomorrow.

    Thanks,

    Alex
