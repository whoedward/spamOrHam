Hi NTS,

I walked into McCormick this morning to find all the microphones and other equipment that I set up for continuing ed yesterday morning . In addition, the system was still on and probably had been left on all night. This is really bad for our projectors and not the way we want to treat our equipment. Please make sure that you are double checking event end times while you are on shift and clean them up in a timely manner, and also make sure that at the very least we are doing a full sweep of the building on each closing shift. Thanks!
