Hi all,

I have a homework 8 with no name on it. Since I need to upload the grade, I need to know whose hw it is. If it is yours please let me know ASAP. I'll hand out all the graded HWs at the beginning of today's review session. If you can not be there please try to get your HW back from Prof. Burghardt.
