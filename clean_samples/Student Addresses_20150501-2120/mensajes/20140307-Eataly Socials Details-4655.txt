Hey guys,

The Eataly social is tomorrow. That should be exciting. This email was intended to be a reminder email. but I realized that I never gave details on time for this social, so I better do it now.

We are going to meet in the ISRC lobby at 10:45. The 'L' ride takes an hour. We'll probably spend 1.5 to 2 hours in the market and then head back up to get to ISRC by 3:00. See you tomorrow!

Your Social Chair (for just a little bit more)
Jonas
