Hey you guys! 

So if you're going home/ are home for Thanksgiving, GO HAVE FUN and don't read this email.

But If you ARE STAYING FOR THANKSGIVING

A fellow has requested that we go to dinner with her on SATURDAY night. SUPER AWESOME EXEC is paying for it, so you'll be eating FOR FREE. 

Afterwards, we're going to have a lovely hot chocolate, cookies, hand turkeys, and post it note party in the lounge and probably watch a Christmas Movie.

SO:
If you are staying then please e-mail me back EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG WITH ME. it's cool. no hard feelings. I won't take it personally.

IF YOU DO WANT TO HANG OUT WITH ME please tell me so I know how many people to expect for dinner.

tl;dr- EMAIL ME IF YOU ARE STAYING AT ALL DURING BREAK.

Happy Turkey Day!,
Hali
