Hey Guys,

Can you e-mail me when you finish your portions of the group exercise?

I cannot submit out teamwork memorandum until everyone has completed theirs. The error message I received said Jack and Jonas are the only two who still need to complete theirs, so, assuming that's true, please e-mail me when you finish, so I can submit this before midnight tonight and we can get credit for it.

Thanks in advance,
Will Krinsman
