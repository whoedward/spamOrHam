Hello Michael,

I'm writing to you to inform you that I did not clock in on the days of Wednesday, the 17th of October and Wednesday, the 10th of October, from approximately 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. These were the weekly meetings for tech services, and I was unaware that I was supposed to record my time spent in them. If I have sent this to the wrong person, or you need any more information at all, feel free to ask. 

Thank you,

Ethan Robison
