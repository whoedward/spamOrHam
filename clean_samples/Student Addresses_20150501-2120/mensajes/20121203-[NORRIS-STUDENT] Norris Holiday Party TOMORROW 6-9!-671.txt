So much to eat and decorate, plus a relay race with prizes! Wear your ugly sweaters (another prize here!!), and your Norris name tag if you have one! Signing in gets you points for your department!

It's a win-win reading week situation.

With Love and Glad Tidings to You and Yours this Holiday Season,
Meredith
