I want to thank you for taking the time to complete the application and meet with us for an interview.

I want to congratulate you and welcome you to the McCormick Student Advisory Board!  There were a lot of applicants and we were happy to have you as a member of the board.

The ideas you presented to us and your involvement on campus will be a great fit as we move forward.

Our first full board meeting will be Thursday October 30th at 7 pm in L250 (Deanâ€™s Conference Room).

Please send me a pic of you as well as a little blurb about your major, involvement, interests(project based).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

Again congrats! See you Thursday,

Jason Arnold
