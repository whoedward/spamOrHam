    Alright - I've got class during Friday 10am-12pm and Monday 2pm-4pm, so I guess I'll trade you for the Monday open shift.

    Thanks man - I appreciate it.

        Hey I can take this but don't really want more shifts. Could you trade me for one of these:

        1. Friday 10am-12pm
        2. Monday 8am-10am
        3. Monday 2pm-4pm
