The show is on may 11th. So I won’t be able to make the first 6 meetings:/ (including today) But I promise I will be at the meetings after may 7:)

I was wondering if it’ll be ok for me not attend meetings for the first couple of weeks? After the show is over I’ll make sure to come! If there are shifts that need to be covered please let me know and I’ll try to help out as much as I can.
