Hello Dr. You,

I am Ethan Robison, one of your freshman advisees. I am emailing you in regards to my Spring quarter schedule. Because I do not need the third part of organic chemistry, I am considering dropping the class. However, I wanted to check with you both to see if this would be okay and to ask if there are any classes that you would recommend that I take in its place. If there is anything that I can do to help you with this, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
