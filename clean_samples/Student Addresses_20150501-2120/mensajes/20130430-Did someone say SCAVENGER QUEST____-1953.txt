Hey y'all!

The dorm's been looking pretty boring recently. So that's why your lovely exec board decided to spice things up by having a SCAVENGER QUEST!!!
From Saturday, May 4th to Saturday, May 11th, ISRC will become a dangerous arena of wit and perception! Who can unravel the clues to find my deviously placed parchment?
You can form teams of up to 3 ISRC residents. Winners will receive $50 for the whole team.
E-mail me by this Friday at 6:00 pm if you wish to participate. If you want to play as a team, have one of you e-mail me the members of your team. I will send out the rules of the game once I have a finalized list of who is playing.

So come join the fun!
Thomas
