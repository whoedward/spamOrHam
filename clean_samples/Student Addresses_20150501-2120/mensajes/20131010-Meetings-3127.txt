Hey Juan,

This is just a reminder for you about the importance of attending the weekly meetings. In addition to be a required aspect of the Tech Services position, it's also helpful for your co-workers, who need all of the help that they can get to cover events and shifts. In the future, be sure to either attend the meetings or send a valid excuse to ntssupervisors@gmail.com prior to the meeting.

This email also serves as a formal verbal warning.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me or any of the other supervisors!

Regards,
Ethan
