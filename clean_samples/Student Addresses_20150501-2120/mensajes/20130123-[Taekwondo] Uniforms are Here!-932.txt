Hey everyone,

The uniforms arrived today, so if you ordered one, you can pick yours up at practice tonight. Also be sure to bring me 18 bucks because that's what you owe me if you ordered a uniform. And I like to do these sorts of transactions old school style. Cold hard cash only please.

Now I KNOW what you're all thinking. "I'll just stop by the ATM real quick before practice and hand him a 20. Then he'll give me change. lololol" Well, I've got good news and bad news for you folks. The good news is that I have 6 bucks to give all three of you who ordered a uniform. The bad news is that only 4 of those 6 bucks are one dollar bills and the rest are quarters. Yes, that's right. One of you unfortunate souls is walking away from practice today with a new uniform and 8 quarters.

See you all at practice. :)

Ji-hoon
