Hey everyone,

Sorry for the all-caps subject line, but this e-mail is really important. With the end of the quarter approaching, preparations for housing for next year will soon be underway. To get a head start, I want to make sure I get a preliminary count of who plans to live here next year. The following information is vital for helping you make a decision:

1) You must be on 3rd list on both the Fall and Winter Quarters to be eligible to live in ISRC again. If you do not fall under these lists, please contact me immediately so we can discuss special arrangements.

2) If you are planning to live in ISRC again but wish to room with someone who isn't currently living in ISRC at the moment, only the current ISRC resident needs to be on 3rd list. Basically, if you are on 3rd list, you can bring along any NU student as your roommate!

3) You will be able to choose your room! The more points you have, the higher priority you have in room selection. So if you are considering living here again, you should start finding possible room choices.

I want to make housing work for anyone who wants to make it work too, so please contact me as soon as possible about your possible intent on living here next year.

Thanks,
Thomas
