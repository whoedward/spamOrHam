    Any spelunkers out there?  I need a volunteer who would like to crawl in the catwalk and help focus stage lights later this week.  Please do not volunteer id you donâ€™t like small spaces. 

    Re-focusing the lights is something we will need to do from time to time- so if you volunteer you will have access to extra hours now and in the future.

     

    Thanks,
