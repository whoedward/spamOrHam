Hi everyone,

Just a reminder to meet outside of the Marketing office on the 3rd floor today at 1 PM if you want to be in the group shot for the Norris DM video! 

Yay!

    Hi Norris employees,

    Do you want to be a DM-star? 


    Good news! Norris is putting together a short video for Dance Marathon and we want YOU to be in it. We’re looking for a couple of volunteers from each Norris department to show off their spaces during a few short shoots early next week.


    Additionally, we’re planning to shoot with a large group of student employees next Thursday (2/18) from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in Norris so if you’re free then and want to be one of the coolest kids on the block, please email our videographer Christine (ccn@u.northwestern.edu) by TOMORROW (2/20).


    Looking forward to seeing your faces in our life-changing video ,
