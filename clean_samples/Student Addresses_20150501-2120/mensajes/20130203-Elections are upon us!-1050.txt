Hey everyone, 

We did not have Open Exec tonight, so I am officially announcing 2013-2014 Exec Board Elections. If you are interested in running for a position, here is a quick rundown of how this will work: 

1) Please read the attached ISRC Constitution and Exec Responsibilities files for more details of each position. Please be committed to be on Exec for the next three quarters (spring/fall/winter). 

2) Fill out the Petition for Election Eligibility. Copies are available on my door (room 309), and I have also attached it. This is a constitutional formality, but it also shows us that at least 10 percent of residents believe you are capable for your desired position. Please slide completed petitions under my door by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, February 13th. 

3) Elections will be on Sunday, February 17th, in place of our weekly Open Exec. Details on the voting process to come. 

Please approach any of the Exec members if you have any questions or concerns. We want to see ISRC in good hands next year, and would be happy to share our experiences. Being on Exec is hard work, and definitely a commitment, but it is a wonderful experience and a taste of "the real world" as our master staff puts it. 

You > midterms. Rock those multiple choice and blue-book exams.
