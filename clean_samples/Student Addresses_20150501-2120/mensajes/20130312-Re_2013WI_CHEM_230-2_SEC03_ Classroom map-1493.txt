Hello Doctor Priest,

I am emailing you in regards to my seat number during the Lab Final. 

I believe that I was sitting in seat 12.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    as I explained in my email this weekend, I would be sending out a map of LR2. It is attached. Please look at it and, as best you can remember, please email me the # of the seat you were sitting in. Even if you don't know exactly what seat you were in, a best guess will be helpful.
    Thanks,
    OPP
