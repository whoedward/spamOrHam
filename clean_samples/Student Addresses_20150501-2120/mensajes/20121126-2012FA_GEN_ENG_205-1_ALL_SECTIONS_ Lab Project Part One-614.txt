Hi EA1 Students,

This message is to clarify the Lab Project submission process for Part One. On Blackboard, there is a place to submit your lab project parts under Assignments > Lab Project, divided into Part One and Part Two. There are also template files there.

The Part One template text file provides a consistent framework for you to submit your answers to Part One of the Lab Project. Be sure to fill in the answers to exercises 3-5 at the bottom. No response is required for exercise 2.

If you hear a loud screeching when you play PureTones on your computer, you may need to scale the result of the toneVector produced by PureTone(). i.e. within your PureTone() function, instead of

toneVector = cos(_____)

try

toneVector = 0.7*cos(_____)

Adjust the factor in front of the cos until the pure tones play clearly.

Please let me know if you have other questions on the lab.

-Ilya Mikhelson
