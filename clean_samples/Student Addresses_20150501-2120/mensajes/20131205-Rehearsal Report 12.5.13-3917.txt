Rehearsal Notes:

    We were able to were able to review a lot of the blocking in Act 3 today and fix it, which was great. David, unfortunately, was sick and the last minute, so we were not able to go through the majority of Act 3 with him, which was why we ended early. (Act 3 post-death is mostly Antony.)

    Caesar will need to be reviewing some papers (“official Caesar shit”) at the beginning of the transition in Scene 3.1 when they all “go to the Capitol” (p. 31-32)
