Hi Alex,

I wanted to follow up about your missed shift this morning. You did not show up for the 8am-10am open. As of right now this constitutes an unexcused missed shift and requires us to warn you that any further infractions will result in disciplinary action. 

If there was any type of misunderstanding or if there is anything that we can do to help prevent this from occurring again, please let us know.
