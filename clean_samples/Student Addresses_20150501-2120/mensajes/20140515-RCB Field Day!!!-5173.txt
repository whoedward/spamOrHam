Hey ISRC!

In case you missed the fireside last night, here is some more information about RCB Field Day. Be on the look out for another email from me today about how to sign up.

COMING UP IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS
THE GREATEST DAY OF THE YEAR

RCB FIELD DAY!!!

Dress up in all of your RC gear and head over to the lakefill for a day of games, competition, and relaxation. 
Grab some free food and free RCB gear, play in the moon bounce and obstacle course, and compete to win trophies and eternal glory.

Put your master in a shopping cart and race the cart around the lakefill in Master's Mile
Strap yourself into an inflatable foosball table and play soccer in Human Foosball
Strategize and run around in a massive game of Capture the Flag
Show off your sweet muscles and your bottomless stomach in Tug of War and the Pizza Eating Contest
RSVP to the Field Day Facebook event to learn about many more events.

Remember to like the RCB facebook page (facebook.com/NorthwesternRCB) and make sure you're in your RC's facebook group to earn your RC points for Field Day!
