Will and Ryan,

Today on the morning shift, I found that both office keys were still on the walkies, the sheets for the day were not dropped off in Mike's office, and one of the av bags was left in the hollow. These things are your responsibility on the rotation, as they are with all closes. Please don't forget next time.

From,
Michael Wang
