This reminder is sent to all returning students regarding your Health Insurance Coverage for the 2013-2014 Academic Year.  Visit the NU / Aetna Student Health Homepage for more insurance information: www.aetnastudenthealth.com.

Prior Year Aetna Members
If you elected the NU sponsored Aetna Student Health Insurance Plan this past Academic Year 2012-2013 and wish to remain on the Plan for the upcoming Academic Year 2013-2014, please complete your Full Time class registration for Fall Quarter 2013 as soon as possible.  Enrollment in the NU / Aetna Plan for the 2013-2014 Academic Year will be triggered by full-time class registration for Fall, 2013 classes.

WAIVED Students
Returning students who WAIVED the NU sponsored Aetna Student Health Plan and wish to continue with that selection, do nothing.  The WAIVER will “roll over” based upon your Full Time registration posting within the CAESAR system.

WAIVED Students Needing Coverage
Students in need of securing coverage under the NU/Aetna Plan but WAIVED coverage last Academic Year should sign into your CAESAR Account and complete the online Coverage Selection Form prior to the close of the Open Enrollment period for Fall Quarter 2013.  The Open Enrollment period is: July 1, 2013 – October 1, 2013.  Follow the outlined steps and submit.  Your Full Time class registration posting in CAESAR for Fall Quarter 2013 will activate your enrollment into the Plan.

The online Coverage Selection Form instructions can be found at: www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/insurance.aspx.  You are strongly encouraged to complete the form by August 1, 2013.

International Students
International Students do not need to complete a Coverage Selection Form.  Enrollment into the NU/Aetna Plan will occur automatically.  As defined by the University, “International Students are those holding F-1 or J-1 United States Visas.”   

Questions regarding this matter can be e-mailed to: student.insurance@northwestern.edu or by phoning the Student Insurance Office at:  Evanston Campus – (847) 491-2113  Chicago Campus (312) 503-1242.
