    Hi all,
    I hope your quarters are all starting off well.
    I know you all have been waiting to hear about the status of our IM teams this quarter.
    Well, I am excited to announce that our sports for the quarter are basketball and floor hockey. 
    If you are interested in playing either of those sports, please sign up using the following links. When you are filling out the doodle polls, please put the gender you identify as in parentheses following your name. I imagine we will be starting next week or the following.
