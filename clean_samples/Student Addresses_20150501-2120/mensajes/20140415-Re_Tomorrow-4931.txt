That would probably work quite well.

When will you be passing through and where can I meet you?

    Thurs doesn't work at all and I'm out of town for a wedding this weekend; how about if I swung by and picked you up on my way back from the vet? It could give us a little more time ( I'm coming from N Rockwell and I usually take Asbury to Green Bay) I am trying to get to an acupuncture appt by 5 as well
