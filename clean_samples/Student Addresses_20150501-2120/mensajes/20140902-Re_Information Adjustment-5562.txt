Hello April,

My apologies for the lack of helpful information.

I have completed and returned my COE packet.

Best,

    Good Afternoon,

    Unfortunately, I seem to have made a small error in reporting my address information in the forms that I submitted.

    I realize that there is a line that I can call to help with this issue, however I have misplaced or am unable to find the relevant information.

    As such, is there anyone whom I can contact to amend the issue?
    If I have contacted you in error, I apolgize. Thank you in advance.

    Best,
    Ethan R.
