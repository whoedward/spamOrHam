Hi ISRC!

Glad that you are all back on campus and ready for another quarter.

I have attached a little letter on all of your doors. Please give that a read when you have a chance. Or if you want, I have attached a pdf of the same letter to this email. 

Have a great first day of classes tomorrow! You got this!

Best,
Esteban
