Hi Norris employees,

Do you want to be a DM-star? 


Good news! Norris is putting together a short video for Dance Marathon and we want YOU to be in it. We’re looking for a couple of volunteers from each Norris department to show off their spaces during a few short shoots early next week.


Additionally, we’re planning to shoot with a large group of student employees next Thursday (2/18) from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in Norris so if you’re free then and want to be one of the coolest kids on the block, please email our videographer Christine (ccn@u.northwestern.edu) by TOMORROW (2/20).


Looking forward to seeing your faces in our life-changing video ,
