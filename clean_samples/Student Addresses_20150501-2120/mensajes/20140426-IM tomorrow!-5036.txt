Hey everyone! Time for softball tomorrow!

Our game is at 3 versus Slivka at Long Field. Please meet me in the lobby at 2:30 if you want to come! We really really need people so please consider it if you are free! We should be done by around 4.

No uniform requirements, except really no cleats Bring gloves if you have them.
Please consider coming if you are free! Please ! We have one person, male, from CCS coming, so we really need a good amount from ISRC to come!

tl;dr: Meet at 2:30 in the lobby if you want to play. No cleats. Bring gloves if you have. Please come. I'll buy you snacks.

Thank you so much.
Paul Kim
