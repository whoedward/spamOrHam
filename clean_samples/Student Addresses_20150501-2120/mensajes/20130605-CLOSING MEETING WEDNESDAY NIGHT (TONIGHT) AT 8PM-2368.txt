Hi guys,

Happy reading week! As we approach the end of the quarter, we will be having our last mandatory floor meeting about end of the year closing. It will be in the main lounge at 8PM and I will go through the procedures and to-do lists for closing. Read the instructions posted on the bulletin boards and emailed to you by Amanda. This will be a short 30 minutes meeting. Bring a bowl as there will be ice cream. PLEASE PLEASE COME as I want to make sure everyone knows the procedures and no one gets fined or delayed. If you have any questions about closing, shoot me an email. Hang in there everyone! WE ARE ALMOST THERE!!!!

Best,
Danny
