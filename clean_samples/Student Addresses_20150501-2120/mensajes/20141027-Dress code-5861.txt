Hello! 

Due to the town hall cutting into chapter today I am making this announcement over the listserv. It has come to my attention that some of us are critical of the dress code. I'd love to make a committee of student staff (hopefully, at least one person per area), to work on alternatice guidelines to submit to Kelly or Amy. Please e-mail me delaneybuenzli2017@u.northwestern.edu if you are interested so that we can make a consistent time to meet.
