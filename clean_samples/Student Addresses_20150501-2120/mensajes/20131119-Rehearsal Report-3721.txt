Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a very productive day, and are actually now ahead of schedule! We got through blocking everything that we’d wanted to cover today and tomorrow. We now have a fight choreography day scheduled (Dec. 26), which means we can move things up a day and leave that mostly free to work on fights and safety.
    With the schedule we now have, we may be able to get through blocking Act II by the beginning of next week!

Scenery Notes:

    Nikolaj, Maia and I were wondering where the backstage area will be? 

Prop Notes:

    Would definitely like to put poster(s) on the Shanley pole for the first scene, at least

Costume Notes:

    None today!

Light Notes:

    For much of scene 1.2, there will be just two or three actors in a corner USR—we’d like to have light in just that corner for that part (streetlight?)

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    In case you didn’t see Matt’s email from earlier today, please fill out the form for fundraising addresses by Sunday at midnight! Here’s the link: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1uwAOViA7Crmv_g-GFG7VZLRExC0jd0_iKL6dfseuCqU/viewform.
