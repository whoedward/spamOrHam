Hey everyone, yesterday I sent out an email but accidentally sent it to the summer NTS listserv.  I'm not going to be back in town yet tomorrow and so can't make my 8am-10am monday shift.  It's an early one but usually there's literally no events at that time so it's a very low-stress shift.  I'll be back in town later this week since I'm helping my family with things here, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help with this.  Thanks!

Alex
