We invite seniors who plan to pursue graduate education in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, or any of the Engineering disciplines to explore the Tufts University Soft Material Robotics – IGERT website. Information on how to apply for a Soft Material Robotics – IGERT Fellowship is available on the website.

 

As a recipient of the National Science Foundation’s prestigious IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship) award, Tufts University has accepted the challenge of establishing new models for graduate education and training. Our goal is to create a collaborative environment in which our research transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, with a focus on soft material robotics.
