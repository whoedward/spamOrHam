Hi NTS, here's this week's meeting notes.

Announcements -

The new schedule is pretty much set, but if you have any more conflicts please send them out on the listserv as soon as possible. I know some of you are low on hours, we are working with Michael on ways to remedy that.

Please remember to show up to your shifts on time. If you are going to be running late, make sure to text/call the other person on shift so they know you are going to be late.

Meetings still count as shifts, if you don't send the supers a proper reason for missing a meeting, verbal warnings will start to be issued.

Here is the schedule for this quarter, along with rotations and phone numbers on the other tabs.

Thanks,

Alex
