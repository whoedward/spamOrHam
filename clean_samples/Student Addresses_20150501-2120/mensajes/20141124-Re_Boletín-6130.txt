    Last e-mail, sorry, one more thing - from what I saw when the other groups turned theirs in, they had a title page with a color picture and their names/the class on it. I uploaded a cover page to Google Drive, maybe we can use it? It's not as detailed as theirs, but it still works, unless you want to change it. We could just stick it in front of the inner title page you made and that way we don't mess up the numbering.

        Just to let you know - I made the changes to the individual copies of each, not the ones in the big file

                Hey, turns out I changed all I needed to. On Google Drive there were three documents that didn't have the same name format as the others - my description, and your argument/narrative. I changed these on the drive

                Thanks a lot for putting it all together!
