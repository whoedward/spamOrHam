Hi everybody, we have our first ISRC trip of the quarter!

We will be going to the Chicago Botanical Gardens in Glencoe, which is just a short metra ride away. The date for this trip will be next saturday, 4/27 at 10:30 AM.

The metra schedule is 10:58 AM leaving Evanston Davis Street towards Braeside. From the Braeside station, it will be about a 20 minute walk to the Gardens.

We have the option of returning on the 2:39PM or 4:39 PM metra so we will leave that decision to the group.

The tentative plan right now is to take the metra up to the botanical gardens, eat lunch nearby, then spend our time at the gardens until we feel like leaving.

Remember, everything is subsidized so there is NO COST TO YOU.

We will be taking 10 people and we will be sending out an email 2:00PM tomorrow. The first 10 people to reply will get spots!!

Stay in tuned,
Kyle and Jonas
