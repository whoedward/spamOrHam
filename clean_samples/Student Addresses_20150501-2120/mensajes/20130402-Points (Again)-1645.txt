Hello, Hannah,

I do hate to bother you about points even further, but I definitely want to live here next year. A friend of mine advised me to explain to you that my schedule was rather full last quarter. I am not certain if it is any excuse for the particular points that I missed, but I did have:

Aikido Club 6 p.m. - 8 p.m. Mondays and Fridays
Tae Kwon Do 8 p.m. - 10 p.m. Mondays
Work Study (at Norris) 8 p.m. - 12 a.m. Tuesdays and 2 p.m. - 4 p.m. Wednesdays
Orgo Lab 6 p.m. - 10 p.m. Wednesdays

Some of these things are less "activities" than they are obligations, but I wanted to let you know that it wasn't the case (the vast majority of the time) that I was sitting around in the suites doing nothing. Hopefully this information is useful. If there is anything at all that I could do to help improve the likelihood that I will be able to live in ISRC please let me know; I really like it here and would definitely like to come back.

Thanks,
Ethan
