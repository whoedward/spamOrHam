Hey Ethan,

Sorry - I'd told Alex about my recurring conflict this quarter, so I didn't know I'd have to also send an email; I should have done so just in case anyway, though.

I've got a 6:30-9:30pm lecture every Wednesday.  Will I need to email the supervisors this every week?

Sorry for the confusion,
Ryan

    Hey Ryan,

    I'm emailing because you missed last night's meeting and did not email the Supers with an excuse ahead of time. Please know that meetings are mandatory and as such this counts as a missed shift. If you have any questions, please email me or NTSsupervisors@gmail.com.

    Regards,
