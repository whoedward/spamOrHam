Hi all,
As previously stated, RCB is hosting a water balloon fight at 3pm at the lakefill. This is right in the middle of the fondue social. I will be at the lakefill at 3. If you want to go then please wear purple and meet me there. I don't want to interrupt Coretta's plans so if you are going to the fondue social please go to it! But if not I'll see you at the lakefill at 3.
Thanks,
Paul Kim
