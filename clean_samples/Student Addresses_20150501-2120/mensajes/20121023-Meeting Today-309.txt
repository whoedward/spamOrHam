Hi NTS,

We're having our meeting today, from 7-8pm (tentatively) in the Louis Room. The blood drive ends at 6pm, hopefully they'll have their things cleaned out by 7, otherwise, we'll have to improvise.

Since I'm sending this email so late, if you cannot attend the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by 2pm today with your reason.

I will not be able to attend the meeting, as I have a class that I signed up for during the meeting.

Thanks,

Alex
