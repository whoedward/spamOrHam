Hello friends at ISRC!

My name is Harrison Flagler, and I am a candidate for Student Life Vice President in the upcoming ASG elections. I've gotten to meet many of you over the past two weeks, and you've given me a lot of input as to what you want to see out of ASG.

I'll try and keep this short:

Over this school year, I've had a fantastic opportunity to work very actively in ASG on a whole number of issues which you can read about here. I got to work closely with many Hall Govs, and have had the privilege of being endorsed by many of them, including your senator, Eric Morales.

As a Freshman, I've gotten to actively work in ASG for roughly a whole school year; and I've had enough experience to see how it works, and how it doesn't. My driving passion is to work with you in an honest and open way to make ASG an organization totally dedicated to student-led initiatives, and that will be my mission, starting on day one, and every day after.

I hope you'll check out our website and our platform, and it would be awesome if you'd like and follow our Facebook Page! ASG really is an organization all about the student body - the only thing missing right now is you. I hope to have your support, and look forward to working with you over the next school year; because your vision is our mission.

Thanks a ton!
