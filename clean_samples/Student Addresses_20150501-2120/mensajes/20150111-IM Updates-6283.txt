Hi all,

IM Schedules have come out:

We will be playing Floor Hockey at 7:30 on Thursdays
Basketball on Mondays at 8 and Sundays at 4 (I'm guessing it's gonna be either one depending on the week).

Official schedules will be coming out within the week, but I imagine we'll start playing the week of the 19th.

Best,
Paul
