Well, then. I'd like to apologize once again. There isn't much that I can do to make up for it (as the night is already over); but, I certainly do owe you big time, and if you ever need anything at all (work-related or otherwise), just let me know. I will definitely be present here on out.
Apologies, once again,
Ethan

    Hey,

    It was actually a really big shift because of an event in Louis as well as several other rooms; I was extremely exhausted and frustrated by the end of the night. I really would've liked the help but I do appreciate the apology and you reaching out.

        Hello,

        So, as you might have noticed, I failed to show up tonight...
         I really hope that the shift was a dull, simple one and that you were not inconvenienced in any way.
         Part of me wants to say that I'm not used to the new schedule, but I still should have been there.
        I'm incredibly sorry, and you can count on me showing up from now on.

        Thanks,
        Ethan Robison
