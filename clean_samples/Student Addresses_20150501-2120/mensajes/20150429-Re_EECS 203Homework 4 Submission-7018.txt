Ali,

I am terribly sorry! I will get in touch with Dr. Joseph. Thanks for your time.

    I and Mehjabin are responsible only for your labs, so we do not know about the logistics of your homeworks. Would you please ask this question to Prof. Joseph?

        Hello Ali,

        I am a student in Russ Joseph's 11am 203 class. I was unable to attend lecture this morning and as such did not have a chance to submit the homework. I was not sure where I could take the submission, so I am attaching a scan of my work.

        Hopefully this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, and thanks in advance for you time. Also, where is the office, so that I can find it in the future?

        Thank you so much, and please let me know if you need anything else from me.

        Best,
        Ethan Robison
