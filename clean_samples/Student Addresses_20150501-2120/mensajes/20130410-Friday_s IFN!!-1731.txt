Hi everyone,

This week's IFN will be on Friday at 7pm in the basement.

We will be watching a French comedy film, Le Diner de Cons. (Dinner Game)

This film is the original version of "Dinner for Schmucks."

It's only an hour and a half!

Here's the IMDB if you're interested

THERE WILL BE FOOD

See you there!
Kyle
