Hey, guys,

Just a quick reminder that there is practice today at 8:00 P.M. at Blomquist. Furthermore, since there is a tournament this upcoming weekend and a good deal of people are participating in it, we likely won't be partaking in sparring activities today (as noted by Master Kallo). I will see you guys soon.

Yours truly,
Davin
