My office hours are correct. 

Also, labeling sounds like a great idea. We do have a tech services label maker in the lab.I used it over the summer. Should we just label the cables and remotes with the name of the room? I can slap them on tomorrow.

    Yo supes,

    Yesterday I filled out the office hours on ShiftPlanning for all the supes. Everyone should take a look and make sure yours is correct. I think we should send an email out about office hours and then discuss it futher during the meeting on Wednesday.

    Also, as a side note, I think we should label the cabinets on the second floor with the contents (so people stop taking the VGAs in the Rock Room down to the lab, for example). Let me know what you think.
