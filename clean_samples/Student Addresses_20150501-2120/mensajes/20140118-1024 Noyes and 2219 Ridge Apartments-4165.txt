Hi Teresa,

I wanted to get in touch with you regarding the apartments that we looked at today. Is there a way that I could see an electronic copy of the lease that we would be signing for both the 1024 Noyes and the 2219 Ridge apartments? We would like to review the specifics thereof.

Thanks again for all of your time and help today.

Best,
