Hey all,

This is a reminder for two things:

1. When an event ends on your shift, you are responsible to clean it up.
2. If there are any add-ons, add them to the sheets with Where, What, and When the event ends.

Today at my shift, I found one event that was not cleaned up, which was on the sheets, and two rooms with equipment and no notification on the sheets or a heads up from the people before my shift. I realize it is finals week and we are all busy studying, but this kind of behavior must not happen.

Thanks,
Andrew Jung
