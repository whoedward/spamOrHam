Fellow ChEs,

The location of the Holiday Party is going to be the 2nd floor of Pancoe (outside of Einsteins)

Remember this event will be this Thursday at 7pm

With regard to food, we are going to have pasta, rolls, and salad. We will also have soda and water  to drink.

There will also be a dessert competition. If youâ€™d like to participate, just bring or make whatever your favorite dessert is and the winner of the competition will receive a prize!!!

If anyone would like to participate in a ChE version of a holiday song, please contact Robert Kuo at (rkuo@u.northwestern.edu) for more information.

Thanks and hope to see you all there!
NU AIChE
