    Hey everyone,

    Enjoying your spring break? Unfortunately, I need to plant a few ideas in your head, so bear with me. Continue reading if you plan to live in ISRC again next year.

    Tomorrow I will send out the complete instructions and paperwork you will need to accomplish in order to live here again next year. For now, I will attach a floor plan of ISRC. You get to choose your room this time, so use this floor plan to pick at least 3 possible rooms you would like. Based on your points from the last 2 quarters, you will hopefully get a room you would like. It is at my discretion to assign you a room that you have not listed if people have already claimed that room due to having more points.

    Remember, the first floor is separated by gender, and that unfortunately cannot change yet. Also, you CANNOT choose a double for yourself. You can only choose a double if you plan on having a roommate.

    I'll send out the super complete housing e-mail tomorrow, so stay tuned for that. It may seem as if I'm handling housing too early, but I need to get all of this information to the housing department during the first week of classes, so please think about which rooms you want now.

    Thanks!
    Thomas
