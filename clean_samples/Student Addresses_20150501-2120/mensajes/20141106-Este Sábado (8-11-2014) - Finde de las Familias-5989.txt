Hey all,

Just a heads up for those of you working this Saturday (11-8-2014): it's family weekend, which means that a lot of fancy people will be in and around Norris, and also that a lot of people will be there in general.

The shifts themselves are pretty low key, but there will be some VIPs about, so everyone needs to be on point. In other words, spend some time with every client, hang out on the first floor so that you're ready to go, and just generally be pleasant.

Also, be sure to wear either your polo or some nice (business casual) clothes.

Best of luck, and feel free to reach out if you need help.

Regards,
