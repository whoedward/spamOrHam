Can anyone possibly grab this?  I can swap one for later in the week/finals week, if you'd like.

        Hey friends,
        It looks like I won't be back until Thursday, so I wanted to check if anyone could grab my Wednesday 6pm-10pm.  It's during the meeting so you'd be going there anyway.  This way you just get paid more.  Hooray.  Lemme know yall.  Thanks!

        Alex
