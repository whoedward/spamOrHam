Hi Kylee,

Hope your quarter is going well.  I am writing to see if you and your collaborator wanted to put your final piece from sculpture last quarter in the Art Department open house taking place March 6 from 10-5.  If you are interested, we can discuss the possibility of finding a loaner laptop.

Best,
Allison
