Hey NTS,

Welcome back to campus! Our first meeting of the quarter will be on Wednesday, January 7th, at 7pm. Location is pending an open room that day.

For this meeting, bring shifts that you want to give up permanently based on your schedule (do NOT release these on shiftplanning), and as usual release shifts on shiftplanning for temporary shift coverages. We'll also be determining Continuing Ed. and Rotation hours if you want more hours.

Thanks,

--
