Hello everyone, tomorrow will be our first wednesday practice starting at 8:30 at boom.  We will go for an hour, and the focus will be more on developing the skills learned in the past few weeks of Sunday practices.  However, if this is your first time don't be discouraged, everyone should be able to jump in.  The second half of class will be rolling, so bring a mouthguard if you have one.

See you tomorrow!
