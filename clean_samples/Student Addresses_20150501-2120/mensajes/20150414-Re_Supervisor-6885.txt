Hi Chris,

Unfortunately, my plans have changed; I am not interested in being a supervisor for the 2015-2016 academic year. I am still certainly going to be a member of the NTS team, just from the postion of an ordinary tech.

Hopefully this is alright. Believe me when I say that the experience as a super has been a blast.

Cheers,
Ethan

    Hey Ethan,

    You had expressed to both Michael and I your interest in being a Tech Supervisor again next year.  The application deadline closed Sunday, and I did not receive an application.  Have you changed your plan for next year, or did you simply miss the deadline?  If you’re interested, please get me your materials by the end of the day today.  Thanks!
