Hello Caesar Team!

Hope everyone is well and having an awesome quarter. First, a big thank you to each and every one of you for joining the team. I can't wait to begin this process and I am so excited to have the opportunity to work with such a talented group of people. A couple of housekeeping things:

1) PROD MEETING DOODLE - Please fill out this Doodle ASAP to specify what days and times work best for you to have prod meetings. We want as many people as possible to be able to attend. Our first prod meeting will occur on one of these dates/times the week of November 11, so mark your calendars and get pumped!

2) CONTACT SHEET - Our wonderful Stage Manager Alina has been gathering your email addresses and phone numbers to create a Contact Sheet, so everyone can get in contact with one another. There are still a couple of you for whom we do not have contact information, so if you could update this sheet that would be great.

3) READ-THROUGH - We will be kicking off the rehearsal process with a read-through of the play on NOVEMBER 13. This is open to everyone and I highly encourage everyone, no matter your role on the team, to attend. It is a great way to familiarize yourself with the play, brainstorm ideas for your work, meet other team members and of course, have fun! If you are attending, please email Alina at alinacarrel2016@u.northwestern.edu.

4) DESIGNER POW-WOW - Maia and I have met with many lead designers individually so far, but we want to have an "artistic pow-wow" of sorts all together before the start of prod meetings. Based on your responses from the above Doodle poll, Maia and I plan on scheduling this meeting one week before the official start of prod meetings, just to share ideas and get everyone on the same page. Stay tuned for more information about that. Assistants are absolutely welcome to come (and encouraged) but it is important that lead designers in particular come to this.

Sorry for the massive email! As always, if there is ever anything you need or want help with, do not hesitate to get in touch with me. I am here for every single one of you.

Caesar Love,
Matt Silverman
