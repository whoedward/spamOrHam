Hey all,

I had another last minute thing come up (this reading week has been way more stressful than expected). The show for the team I coach is now at 5pm tomorrow and I should really be there to help warm them up, call lights, etc. I would like to be there starting at 4:30, so I'd like the whole shift covered, but even if someone could just cover the 5-6pm that would be super helpful. 

Thanks,
Tim
