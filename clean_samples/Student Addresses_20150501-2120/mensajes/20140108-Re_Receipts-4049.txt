Hey guys!

I'm sorry to be sending this email so late, but if you gave me receipts they have finally been processed. I will be in Norbucks tomorrow from 1-4. Please come pick up your reimbursements in this time frame or hmu to meet some other time.

xoxo

    Thank you all for an incredible process! I can't even express how happy I am with this show, and you guys made every moment leading up to it fun filled.

    If any of y'all still have receipts to give me, please give these to me by this Thursday so you can be reimbursed.
