    To whom it may concern,

    Hey guys! I will not be able to make the meeting due to it being my sorority's crush party. However, I have looked at Shiftplanner, and I can help out William on Friday 11/14 from 8-12pm. Also, I would love to know any of the out-of-house jobs to see if I can help out.

    Thanks so much and all the best,
