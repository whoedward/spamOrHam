Actually, If Elizabeth or anyone else could take the shift I would appreciated. I just realized I had some plans I had forgotten about. If no one else can do it then I can cancel them but I'd obviously rather not.

Sorry about that!

        Hi Juan,

        If you can cover the entire shift, I think it would be better.

            I can cover it if Elizabeth doesn't want to.

                I have an event that ends around 9 so I could definitely cover you from 9-close if no one else can.

                    Hi NTS,

                    Is anybody willing to pick up my rotation tonight? I have an essay due tomorrow that is just not coming together right now, and I want to focus completely on it for the rest of the day.

                    Thanks,

                    Alex
