    Hello there,
    Yes, do store them electronically, but we would like a hard copy of each for our review, so please print them out on the days when they are due. Also, remember to print two copies, one for Professor Holtgreive and one for me.

    Thanks,

    Professor Herrick

        Hello Professors Herrick and Holtgreive,

        In regards to the submission of certain assignments (namely group assignments such as research summaries, etc.): Would it be possible for us to simply store those documents as googledocs or similar files online in lieu of using paper to print them out? If it is still necessary to submit them, it would be simple enough to share them with the two of you afterwards.

        Thank you for your time,
        Ethan Robison (and the other members of Team Four)
