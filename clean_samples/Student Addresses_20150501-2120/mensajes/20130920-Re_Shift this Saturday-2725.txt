Sorry man - I'm working the 6 hour block before that, and have made plans with friends for that afternoon.

    Hey guys,

    I'm scheduled to work this Saturday 2-6pm.  I'd really like to go to as many football games as I can, especially since this is my last year.  Does anyone want to take this shift?

    Thanks,

    Will
