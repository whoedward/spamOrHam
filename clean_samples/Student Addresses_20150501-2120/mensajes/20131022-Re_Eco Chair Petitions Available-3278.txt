Just so you have a brief overview, the eco chair is in charge of sustainability initiatives for ISRC, including Green Cup, which is happening now. Such things include leading ISRC in Green Cup events, encouraging recycling, encouraging responsible energy and water usage, providing "green" dishwashing supplies for the residents of ISRC, among other things. If you have any questions after Sunday's exec meeting, feel free to contact me.

Our previous eco chair, Leena Vilonen, is willing to work with her successor to help the transition proceed smoothly.

Thanks everyone!

Happy Green Cup!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
