WELCOME TO THE FIRST OF MANY
HORRIBLY COLORFUL ELECTRONIC MAILS
FROM YOUR VP of PR JOHN HARDBERGER
THE ELECTRONIC MESSAGE WILL COMMENCE NOW:

>>Hey guys
>
>>I'm sending you this crazy-advanced e-mail to tell you about the super-important RCB WEBSITE REDESIGN CONTEST. All too soon, prospective students will start looking at dorms and RCs to decide where they want to live when they join the Northwestern community. It's important for you to keep an up-to-date-ish website so that they can make an informed decision. Here's what you need to do and know:
>
>>1. The website contest begins tomorrow. All changes have to be made to your site by MAY 9 at MIDNIGHT. Any changes made after that day WILL NOT COUNT. I have screencaps and notes of your websites as they are now, and the changes will be judges in relation to these contemporary notes. 
>
>>2. There will be prizes in four categories:
>>>>a. MOST IMPROVED
         b. MOST PROSPIE-FRIENDLY
         c. BEST LAYOUT/BEST LOOKING
         d. BEST-IN-SHOW
These criteria will be judged by your one and only RES COLLEGE EXEC BOARD. That said, all aesthetic criteria are kind of ONE BIG MACGUFFIN to get you to update the info on your site, so be sure to do that do and to be accurate and honest in doing so. 
>
>>3. Hopefully you're already have a web-chair/webmaster/tech chair/comfy chair to work from yourself; if not, I suggest locating one that can act in-terim soon. Also hopefully you already have access to your dorm's website. If you don't, let me know ASAP (an acronym the kids are using these days for "AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"; pretty neat, huh?) and I'll get you set up probably. 
>
>>THAT'S ABOUT IT
>
>>FABULOUS PRIZES will be given in the form of TWO $50 gift certificates to various Evanston restaurants to each dorm who's website wins a prize. These are to be shared among whoever helps out on the redesign. 
>
>>If you have questions, you can respond to this electronic mail with an e-mail of your own. Or you can ask me tomorrow morning when I see you not on the internet. In the meantime, bes safe online.
