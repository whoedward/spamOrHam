Ethan, I can still take 5-9 if you want to close like we said before.  Phoebe, do you still want that Saturday shift too?

    Hey guys,

    I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY sorry
    but would you guys mind taking the DM shifts planned before Will freaked out and you guys gave me part of the DM shift on Friday??
    I'M SORRYYYY please? 

    my teacher is dumb.. and she changed the concert schedule and now I could work on Sunday again so I don't need the Friday hours.
    I'm going to e-mail people who said they could cover my sunday hours and ask them if I could have my hours back. If they want the hours, I don't care.. but yea... 

    I'M SO SORRYYYY. (blame my stupid chamber music coach) but anyway, I'M SORRY! Please let me know if you guys could work Friday..
    I think it was Ethan from 5-9 PM and Christina from 9 PM - 1 AM.

    Thanks~
