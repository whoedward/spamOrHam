Hey supers!

As tomorrow is Wednesday and we have our meeting, Here is the link for the updated (nothing on there yet, really) meeting agenda.  I have a mandatory sorority workshop, so I cannot attend.  

I do have one shift coverage - Tuesday 1/14 8PM-midnight - so please get that covered.

Update the agenda as you will!
