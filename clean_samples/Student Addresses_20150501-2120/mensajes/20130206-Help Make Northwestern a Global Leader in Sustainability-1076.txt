> Dear Northwestern Community,
> Our university has a tradition of global leadership in research, education, and public service. Climate change is a defining challenge of this century that we must confront together. Today, Northwestern has the opportunity to lead the transition towards sustainable energy. We call on our fellow members of the Northwestern community to support the following actions regarding our university’s endowment:
>
> 1) Complete divestment from the coal industry
> 2) Increased investment in renewable energy and clean technologies
> 3) Active pursuit of full divestment from the fossil fuel industry in the near future	
>
> Voice your support for these actions by signing the petition here: http://bit.ly/NUSustainableEndowment
>
> On January 30, 2013, the Northwestern University Associated Student Government passed a resolution supporting these actions (full text here). This resolution is the result of months of research and discussion with students, faculty, and staff from across the university. These actions are our duty as world citizens and also align with the values of our institution.
>
> In the words of the Northwestern Strategic Plan, "We will contribute to the solutions for renewable energy and a sustainable environment and to how public policies and economic incentives promote implementation of new technologies and practices.”

Please forward this email throughout the Northwestern community - whether you're an administrator of a Northwestern listserv, in contact with fellow alumni, or connected with others who care about Northwestern's financial and environmental priorities.
>
> Thank you for helping make Northwestern University a global leader in sustainability.

> Respectfully,

> The Faculty, Students, Staff, and Alumni of the Northwestern University Responsible Endowment Coalition
