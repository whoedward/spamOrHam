Agreed on this one. He has gotten away with this stuff too many times.

    Michael and Supes,

    Jake showed up late for work today. His excuse was that he overslept. Since it's a new quarter, Ethan and I had a sit down with him and made it clear that we've been excessively lenient before (a mistake we won't make again) and that this warning is his last one.

    I know firing people sucks, but I would like to have everyone's agreement on this: If he makes another error like this, we ought to let him go.

    From,
    Michael
