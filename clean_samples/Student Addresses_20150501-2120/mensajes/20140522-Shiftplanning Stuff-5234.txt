Hi Everyone, 

Three things:

I'm not sure what's going on with Friday 4-6. I tried to get that shift permanently covered last week but I wasn't at the meeting. I know it got covered at least for last week, but this week Christina had it on the agenda again, so I assumed that it was just a one-week coverage last week so I got Johanne to cover it this week. But shiftplanning says that Edward and Irene are on it now. So I have no clue what's going on. 

The Sunday 8-midnight now has Edward and Johanne on it together. Is that a problem or do you think they know what they're doing enough to handle it? 

Magan emailed me today and he cannot take the Saturday rotation. Can anyone do it? 

Thanks.
