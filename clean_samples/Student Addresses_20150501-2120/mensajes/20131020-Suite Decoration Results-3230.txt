Hey all,

Congratulations to Mexico, Lebanon, Bangladesh, and Nepal for winning the suite decoration contest! And for everyone else, awesome work! Now that the contest is over, I'd like to get everyone's receipts as soon as possible, hopefully some tonight at open exec. Remember, your receipt has to have all the relevant info for me to reimburse it, so check the last email I sent out. 

Good luck on next week's exams,

Victor
