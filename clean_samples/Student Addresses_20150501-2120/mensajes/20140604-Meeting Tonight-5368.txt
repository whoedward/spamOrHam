Hi Supervisors,

I'm sorry to say again, but I won't be able to make this week's meeting due to ASG Senate elections (which will validate my student position for the next year). I don't have any finals week coverages I need covered though. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks!

-Magan
