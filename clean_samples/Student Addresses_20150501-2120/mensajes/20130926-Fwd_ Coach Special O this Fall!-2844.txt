Hi everyone!

I hope your first week of classes is going well!

Special Olympics just released the coaching application for the fall. If you're interested, please see the information and application below. Thanks!

ISRCLove,

Coach for Special Olympics this fall!  

Fill out the application here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J7tStkzgvW60LAFCPXXZG-qCyM1EmclTaOpCdnkefHE/viewform

As a coach, you'll join other Northwestern students to volunteer with Special Olympics athletes, teaching athletic skills while having a great time.  This fall, you can coach Track, Swimming, Basketball, Bowling, or General Fitness.  We also run a weekly Life Skills class where you can hang out with our athletes in a social setting and help with fun activities, such as painting, cooking or trivia!

Questions?  Concerns?  Really Excited?!
