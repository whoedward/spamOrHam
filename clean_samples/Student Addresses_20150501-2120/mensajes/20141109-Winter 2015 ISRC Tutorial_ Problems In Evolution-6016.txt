Hi ISRC!

My apologies for all the emails today, but this one is about the ISRC seminar that will be offered next quarter. 


The seminar will meet once a week, likely 6-9p on Mondays, but that’s up for discussion. 


Our Associate Master, Erin Waxenbaum, will be teaching the seminar and she will be giving a Fireside TOMORROW night in the Main Lounge at 7pm. If you are interested at all in taking the class, please come to the fireside. 


This tutorial counts as a Natural Science Distro, PLUS the class will be held in ISRC. (YOU CAN GO IN YOUR PAJAMAS!!!) 


The course description is below:

 

"We recently celebrated the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth. But what would he think of our world today? We have a sophisticated understanding of genes and the ability to trace our ancestry over generations. Despite this knowledge, conclusive and irrefutable proof that we have or are continuing to evolve has not been found. In this course we will address where we have come from and where we might be going. We will cover some of the major issues in evolution ranging from those originating in Darwin’s time to the many questions that persist today."

 
Best,
Esteban
