Hello Nick,

I am Ethan Robison, a freshman in DTC. I spoke with you earlier today concerning the Arduino for our project (turning over Brian), and you mentioned that the H-Bridge will read the speed and direction from the Arduino, then go from there.

So, if the direction is HIGH (5V) and the speed is 63 (1.25V), the chip will turn the motor a direction (the specifics are not important here) at 25% speed; and if the direction is LOW (0V) and the speed is 63 (1.25V), the motor will turn the other way at 75% speed.

If this is the case, can we wire both speed and direction to the same pin, so that at HIGH the motor will turn 100% one way, and at LOW the motor will turn (100-0)% the other way?

If this is confusing, I apologize. If you need any clarification or additional information, please feel free to ask!

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
