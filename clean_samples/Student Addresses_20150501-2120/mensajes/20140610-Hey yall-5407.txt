Dear friends,
So I took on Ethan's Thursday open 8-10 because the two of us knew that I would not need to be doing my 8:30-10:30 Continuing Ed shift.  However Cont Ed seems to still be on, so I'm scheduled for both of those right now.  Honestly this isn't a problem for me; I'm cool with just doing both.  But if this is some sort of problem that by definition needs to be addressed, I'm letting all of us know.

Alex
