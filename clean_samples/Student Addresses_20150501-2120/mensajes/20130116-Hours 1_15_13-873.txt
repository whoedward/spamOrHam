Hello Michael,

First off, it was nice to meet you today (finally). Additionally, regarding hours from last night (1/15/13) until today: I worked yesterday from 8:00 p.m. until 12:15 a.m. The system clocked me out early. the system also had me clocked in when I arrived today. I did not clock in until 2:00 p.m. I clocked out at 4:00 p.m.

Thanks again,
Ethan Robison
