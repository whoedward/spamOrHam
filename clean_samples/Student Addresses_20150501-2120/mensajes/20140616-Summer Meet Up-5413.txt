Hey Guys,

The idea of a summer meetup has been thrown around, but let's see if we have some actual interest. So respond with your level of commitment, location preferences, and ideal dates. Also if there is anyone else who I missed and you think would be interested let me know.

Side note: I found all our locations in latitude and longitude and averaged them to find the "best" place to meet up. And it is ... LIGONIER, INDIANA! (41.444, -85.553)

Hope your summers are off to a good start,
Jonas
