Hey DTC'ers,

My name's Sam and I'll be your TA for this quarter of DTC. I'm currently in the M.S. Engineering Design & Innovation program at Segal (basically, a masters in DTC), and did my undergrad in engineering here at NU. I'm here as a resource to you all, if you have any questions about anything DTC: graphics, the design project, shop training, etc, absolutely contact me via email or give me a call. I love this stuff and am here to help.

I'll be holding "office hours" on Tuesday from 5p-7p, and Wednesday from 3p-4p, located at a 1st floor Ford atrium table. Come on over with questions and we'll work through them. If you can't make office hours, contact me and we'll set something up.

Again, I can be reached via email or cell.

Cell: (773) 357-5280

Looking forward to working with you!

Cheers,
-Sam
