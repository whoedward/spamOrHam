HELLO ISRC. 

There is a screening of "Tohoku Tomo" with Q & A with the director and the screen writer on 10/15/14 in NU Library Forum Room.

This is a documentary film telling the story of true friendship and commitment to Japan’s recovery by the international community following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Many of these people dropped what they were doing and dedicated themselves to Japan’s recovery. Many of these them even took it upon themselves to establish non-profit organizations aimed at connecting with and rebuilding Tohoku and its communities.

'The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something.'
