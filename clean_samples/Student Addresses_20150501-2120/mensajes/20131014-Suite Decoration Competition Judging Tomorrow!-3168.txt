Hey everyone,

I hope you're almost done with your suite decorations because the competition is coming to a close! The master staff will be here tomorrow at 4pm to admire your decorations and decide which suites will win prizes!

If you want a competitive edge, have at least 1 person to represent your suite and explain all of your decorations. Remember, the winning suites will receive more money for munchies, meaning more food!!!

Thomas
