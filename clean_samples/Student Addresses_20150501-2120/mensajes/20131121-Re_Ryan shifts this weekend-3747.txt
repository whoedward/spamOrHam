Thank you for the information, Pete!  For your knowledge, here are the NTS-ers working this weekend:

Friday 5:30-11:30 PM : Jake Degler
Saturday: Alex Schlehuber (11 AM-4PM), Jake Degler (4PM-8PM), Juan Herrera (8PM-10:30PM)
Sunday: Ethan Robison (11AM-3PM), Ryan Littlefield (3PM-6PM), Phoebe Kim (6PM-11:30PM)

NTS-ers, please be aware that you will pick up the keys for Ryan and then meet Pete's staff at the venue.  There is no swiping in this weekend, so remember to write your hours on the paper in the lab.  Also, since most of your work this weekend will be babysitting, make sure that Pete's staff are as fully trained as possible in Ryan (with the tech system, lights, customer interaction, troubleshooting, etc.).

Good luck this weekend!

    Hello all,

     

    Here are the Satellite staff assignments in Ryan this weekend:

    Friday, 5:30p – 11:30p, David Elutilo

    Sat, 4:30p – 7:30p, Maya Siu, Sophie Bartolotta

    Sat, 7:30p – 10:30p, David Elutilo, Willow Pastard

    Sun, 10:30a – 1:30p, David Elutilo, Joshua Klingenstein

    Sun, 1:30p– 4:30p, Connor Smith, Sam Mueller

    Sun, 4:30p – 7:30p, Willow Pastard

    Sun, 7:30p – 11:30p, David Elutilo, Nathan Villa

     

    PSV staff: report directly to Ryan, don’t get keys, don’t swipe (your hours are entered already because of the early deadline).  I do want shift reports though.  When there are two of you on a shift: flip a coin or whatever, but at least one of you submit a report.

     

    NTS staff: please deal with the keys for the weekend’s events.

     

    ALL: There are lots of you babysitting this weekend, I’m trying to get more of my staff trained on Ryan.  Some of my PSV staff working this weekend have never worked in Ryan (others have).  Please be proactive about NTS and PSV staff talking through everything in Ryan – even the stuff you aren’t using this weekend.  Show/talk through the technology system, lights, etc.  NTS share how working in Ryan typically goes, etc.

     

    Also – Sat & Sun is a NCE gospel concert.  They are bringing in risers Saturday and a sound system Sunday.  Sunday night you will need to make sure they get all their gear out and clean up thoroughly.

     

    Thanks,
