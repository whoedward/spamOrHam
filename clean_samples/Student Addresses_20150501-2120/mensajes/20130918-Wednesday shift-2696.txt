Hey yall,
I missed my shift this Wednesday morning at 8-10am.  Since having unpacked in my apartment I've realized that I forgot my alarm at home.  I've been using my phone but actually dropped it in a toilet yesterday and it is thus far non-functional.  This is probably less of a reason and more of an admission of being a moron, but I definitely wanted to let you all know.  I've got that situation figured out but unfortunately it did kind of mess up my schedule today.  Do let me know if I can make it up to you.  I can make balloon animal and have no sense of shame; feel free to be creative.  Thanks guys!
 
Alex
