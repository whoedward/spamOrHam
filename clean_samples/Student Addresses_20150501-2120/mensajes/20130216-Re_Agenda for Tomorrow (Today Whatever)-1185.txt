Oh sorry the essay is due next next Tuesday (8.1) 

along with the Design Freeze Document

So we should try to make a lot of progress with our designs this upcoming week because it's the last week we'll have before the Design Freeze

Then the week after that (9.2) the final prototype is due

In short, 

IT'S DECISION TIME
