Ethan,

I remember that you were interested in hearing a little more about patterns and fractals in applied math.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93B%C3%A9nard_convection - Here is a classic example of patterns formed by convection.
http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Rayleigh-B%C3%A9nard_convection - Another link to the same phenomena that goes into the math a little more.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map - This is a great example of fractal geometry appearing in the way the solution to an equation behaves.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Logistic_Bifurcation_map_High_Resolution.png - Basically this model describes the growth of a population that saturates when it approaches a carrying capacity, kind of like the growth of bacteria on a petri dish that eventually slows because nutrients run out and space becomes scarce. As we adjust a parameter in this model (the horizontal axis), the solution behaves more and more strangely until a very intricate fractal pattern emerges in the plot. Let me know if you want to know more about this, going further may require more background knowledge.

Hope you find this interesting!
