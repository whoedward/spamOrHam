Hi guys, 

We had a split up the sweeps so that I would take care of the first and third floor rooms and Aliyah would sweep the second floor, though now I figure I should have double checked the second floor as well. 

I apologize for this greatly, and, if needed, I can mention something to Aliyah as well seeing it that we both had the shift together.

    Supers,

    The projectors in Northwestern A and Rock were left on overnight.  Northwestern B had a cart with VGA, remote, Ethernet on it.  Not only is it harmful for projectors to be left on, there was over $50 worth of cables sitting out for anyone to steal.  If shift planning is correct the Techs on duty last night were Aliyah and Bobby. 

    Please let me know if they were the culprits and make sure they know how important it is to turn off projectors.  In addition as you may know we have had a string of robberies in the building- letâ€™s not be easy targets for these folks.
