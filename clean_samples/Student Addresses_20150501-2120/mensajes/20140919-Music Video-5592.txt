Hey guys!

So yesterday when I was stationed at the work at Norris Table (which you should all sign up for) Jake was making us work at Norris Songs and I thought, what a great idea! So basically I was hoping that we could get some creative geniuses (or people who like to have fun) to make some sort of parody music video to a song that conveys our enthusiasm for Norris! The song is TBD so if you have ideas lets hear 'em! I'm not sure how many people we'll need but I'd love to get an idea how many people are interested in participating

p.s. Anaconda has been recommended and Filming will most likely be tonight

Sincerely,
Delaney Buenzli
