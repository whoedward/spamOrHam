Class,

For Thursday, I can also come up with exam-like problems and have you all work on them for ~30 minutes, then we can work through the answers together. This may be better as it will give you more study material, as you already have solutions to the practice final exam. Doing this during discussion time on Thursday could be in addition to a review session sometime afterwards, depending on your interest as a class.

Let me know,

Karna
