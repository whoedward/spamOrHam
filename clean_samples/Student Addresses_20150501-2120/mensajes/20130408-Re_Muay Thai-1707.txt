Festival was awesome.  Sean punched me in the face.  I think I became a better person for it.  Go volunteer for it!

    Hey guys, 

    Muay Thai classes will be startin up again this week. I'm still figuring out the details for when, but I'm looking forward to this quarter of training!

    Please invite your friends to come out and try Muay Thai. We need more people!

    Also, if anyone would like to volunteer to be part of a demo for the Thai Festival, let me know. I did it last year with Calvin and Noah and it was a blast.
