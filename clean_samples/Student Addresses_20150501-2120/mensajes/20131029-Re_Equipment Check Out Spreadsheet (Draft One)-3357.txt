What do the numbers mean for the second column of the second page? Also, maybe include a comments column for check out as well? Just in case. 

This looks awesome though.

    Hey Guys,

    Attached is a copy of the equipment check-in/check-out spreadsheet that I am working on. It is by no means finished (I have ambitions for this bad boy), but I'd love to hear what you guys think so far. Anything from color schemes to missing features to rearrangements. Positive comments and constructive criticisms are encouraged!

    Thanks,
    Ethan
