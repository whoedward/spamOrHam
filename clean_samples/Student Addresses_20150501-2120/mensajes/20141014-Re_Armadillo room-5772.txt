        I had Ethan replace the broken vga input in Dillo this morning.  I failed to remind him to test it. Unfortunately it failed at an event today.  I take full blame.  So, in the mean time if we need a projector in Armadillo room, please use a projector on a cart.  I will attempt to correct the issue first thing Tuesday morning.
