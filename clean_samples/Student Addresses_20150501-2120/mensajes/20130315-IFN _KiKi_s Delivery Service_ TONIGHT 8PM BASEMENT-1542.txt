Wanna let off some steam from Reading Week work?
Come to IFN tonight for a Japanese animation called "KiKi's Delivery Service (魔女の宅急便)"  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMi4HV9vGzg). This is another masterpiece by famous Japanese anime artist Hayao Miyazaki. So take a break from your study and come enjoy the last IFN I am working as Academic Chair of ISRC! 

See you then,
Arkar
