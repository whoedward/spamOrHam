Hey supers,

So we misunderstood the shifts required for this Hardin Hall thing, and these are the shifts:

Monday 8:30-9:30 am
Monday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
Tuesday 8:30-9:30 am - Christina
Tuesday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
Tuesday 3-5 PM - Big Mike & 

Currently I am on the Monday morning on Shiftplanning, but I technicallyyyy have class I should go to.  Is anyone able?
We just need that and someone to help tear down with Big Mike on Tuesday.  The set-up is a snake from their system into our mixer with four wireless kits.  Super simple.

Thanks, guys!
