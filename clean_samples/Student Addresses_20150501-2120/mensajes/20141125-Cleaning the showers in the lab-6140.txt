Hey guys,
So Michael wants the showers to be organized and re arranged. 

What he wants:
1. Stuff moved to the sides of the showers so that you can actually walk into the showers and see the stuff that's stored in there. 
2. An inventory list to figure out what we can recycle (like broken stuff that's can't be repurposed) for Dan to recycle.
If anybody has any free time while on a chill shift, that'd be neat. 

Will
