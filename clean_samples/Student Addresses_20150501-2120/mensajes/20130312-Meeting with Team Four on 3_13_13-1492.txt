Hello, Professor Herrick,

Team Four here. We are available for certain by four o' clock tomorrow. However, if you would prefer to meet earlier, we can potentially meet after two o' clock. This would require a bit of shuffling on our part, but it can be done.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!

Many thanks,
Team Four
