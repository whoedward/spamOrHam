Hey everyone,

Here's a final reminder for housing if you wish to live in ISRC again next year!
Please follow all of the following steps carefully:

1. Sign the residential Services 2014-2015 contract terms and conditions through this link: https://rms.resservices.northwestern.edu
You must do so by Monday April 7 at 5pm. DO NOT get a priority number from this only if you wish to continue living in ISRC. We have a different system for that.

2. Fill in the attached Letter of Intent and give it to me by no later than Friday April 4 at 9am! This form is all you need to secure a spot in ISRC next year, but you cannot turn it in later than this date! Slide them under my door (room 304).

3. See the attached floor plan of ISRC, and choose at least 3 rooms you would like to live in. Your points will determine your priority level in getting your desired room. If all of you preferences are taken, I will try to put you in a room on the same floor and suite if possible. Also, you may not ask for a double if you do no plan on having a roommate. All doubles must have 2 people occupying them.
E-mail me your room preferences by Friday April 4 at 9am.

4. If you have a lack of points but would still like to live here, contact me via e-mail, and we can work something out.

If you have any questions regarding the housing process, let me know, and I'll be glad to assist you.

Thomas
