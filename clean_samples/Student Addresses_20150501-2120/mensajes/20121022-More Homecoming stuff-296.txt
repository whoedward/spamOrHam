Hey,

A few more things: For those of you that don't know Artica is an art studio in the basement of Norris. Also, if we show the most spirit at the parade we win a prize. So when you guys impress the judges with your overwhelming spirit we can use the prize money for a special social. 

Cheers,

Robbie
