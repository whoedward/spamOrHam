Hi all,

I need replies by the weekend if people want to go to either the Two Rivers Tournament 2/15 or the Sparring Referee Seminar on 2/1. They are coming up soon and I need to make sure the logistics are worked out. The Tow Rivers tournament looks to be the lowest key one of the quarter. And it might even be the case that we don't have to get there until the afternoon, so this would be the lowest time commitment as well.

    Hi all,

    This quarter there are a lot of high level tournaments for us to choose from. Many of them require a decision ASAP both so we can train to the level needed and to plan the logistics of actually getting there. The next few paragraphs will describe all the tournaments available this quarter. Please let me know if you are interested in attending any of them and what the likelihood of you going is. The yellow columns in this Google Spreadsheet summarize all the tournaments discussed in this mail.

    The first set of big Tournaments are the State Qualifiers. These tournaments lead to the US Nationals this summer and are some of the highest level tournaments one can do. So any matches will be good experience for those who go, but expect stiff competition. The downside is, due to the large breakdown of divisions, it is not uncommon to have no match, which would be quite a waste of time. All competitors must be registered with the USAT ($35) and need US residency/citizenship to compete. In addition, you need a Kukkiwon Dan to compete at Black Belt level. Please let me know IMMEDIATELY if you want to compete so we can work through the registration & logistics.

    The next two Tournaments are college tournaments, ETEC Princeton and Collegiate Nationals. Both are going to have stiff competition and be well attended, so everyone should have an interesting time. In addition we will try to arrive early to train with the host club, Princeton and Berkley. The downside to these competitions are they are both a long distance away so would need some massive logistical efforts to attend. Personally I think these will be more interesting than the State Qualifiers. Collegiate Nationals has the same requirements as the State Qualifiers for registration. The ETEC tournaments only require that the competitors are full-time students and have medical insurance, though the format is a bit different from normal. Again, please let me know IMMEDIATELY if you want to compete so we can work through the registration & logistics.

    The last set of Tournaments are the locals, Two Rivers TKD Tournament, Great Lakes Cup, and Indy Cup. These are all low key and are nicely spaced so we can hit one in each of February, March, and April. If we don't do any of the previous tournaments we should definitely do these. Please let me know soon if you want to go to the Two Rivers Tournament as I would need to call them for more details to figure out if it is what we are looking for. I hope that everyone tries to go to at least one of these.

    Finally there is a Sparring Referee seminar Saturday February 1st. This is only open to Black Belts. It will be an all day affair. Everyone who wants to go must register with the USAT ($35) and the Seminar costs $60. This will include certification as a USAT Referee which allows you to referee at USAT sanctioned events like State Qualifiers. It is possible to audit this at no cost, but the Master stated that we could only bring 1-2 to audit it. While I think this is a very valuable experience for people, it is probably not worth it unless you intend to referee at high level events instead of competing. Please let me know ASAP if you are interested in attending. In March there is a Forms Seminar, which should be open to more people and I strongly recommend that all Black Belts try to make that. More details on that to come.
