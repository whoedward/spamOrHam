Hey everyone!

Hope you all had a nice winter break!  Our first meeting of the quarter will be this thursday at 7 in the Deanâ€™s Conference Room L250.

We will discuss the potential of moving the date and time of our meetings in the event that there is better time for all of us.

If you can not make it / are on co-op / anything like that, please let Michael or I know!

Best,
Jason
