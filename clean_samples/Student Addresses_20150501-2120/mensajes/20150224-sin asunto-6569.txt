A really interesting article that's been floating around my various Muslim friend circles, to varying responses. This girl's perspective on and interpretation of Islam is definitely not exactly the same as mine (like I've said, I don't really believe or practice at all anymore, other than what I do to keep peace in the family), but her feelings are pretty representative of how I felt much of the time in high school. There is a weird culture of judgment, or fear of judgment, amongst Muslim women that I think stems from Islam promoting such obvious outward physical manifestations of spirituality. A hijab or modest clothing does not necessarily equal humility or piety - but it's the knee-jerk reaction to think so, and to make corresponding assumptions about Muslim women who don't dress so modestly.
