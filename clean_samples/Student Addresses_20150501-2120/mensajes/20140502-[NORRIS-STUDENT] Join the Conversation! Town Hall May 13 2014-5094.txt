Hello All,

Mark your calendars, because the Norris Student Employment Committee is hosting the last Town Hall Meeting of the school year on Tuesday, May 13 in the Wildcat Room (Norris 101) at 4:30pm! Get updates on plans for a new University Center, Dillo Day changes, summer scheduling at Norris, and more. The Town Hall is also a great place to share information on events or news from your area and to meet fellow Norris student and professional staff! If you would like to be on our agenda, please respond to this email.

Also, save the date for the end of the year Student Recognition Banquet on Tuesday, May 27th in the Louis Room (Norris 205) at 6pm! This dinner/award ceremony will give the Norris professional staff the opportunity to thank all of you and recognize graduating Norris staffers as well as staff members who continually go above and beyond. Look for a formal invitation soon!

Best,

Dominique
