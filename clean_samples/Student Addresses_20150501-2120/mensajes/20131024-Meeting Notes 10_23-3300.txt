Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from last night's meeting.

Announcements:

Our training dates for this fall have been set, they are the upcoming 3 Saturdays. The Google Doc for signups are below, and you must attend at least one training session. There will be juice/coffee and donuts, and you will be paid for the training.

The pamphlets on the training wall in Michael's office also need to be completed - tier one training (smart rooms/conference phones) must be completed by Nov 15th. You can do them while you are no shift with any supervisor or during any of our office hours.

Please make sure you are recharging the walkies properly - there needs to be a solid red light that turns on when you put into the charger - anything else means that it isn't charging properly.

Shift Coverages

Joyce Sat 2-4pm ----> Max
Max Sunday 12pm-2pm ------> Magan
Tim Sunday 2-4pm ------> Magan
Alex Wed 6-8 ------> Phoebe
Kara Thurs 10/31 12-2pm ----> Ethan

Thanks,
