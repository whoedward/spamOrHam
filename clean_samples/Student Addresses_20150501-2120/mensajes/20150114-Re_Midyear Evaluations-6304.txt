        Hey when are you free? I am usually good to go anytime after 5, or on the weekend particularly on Saturday between 2-4 or Sunday from 10-2.

                Hey guys,

                I have you all for midyear evaluations, which means that we each need to meet one-on-one. It will be in Norris, you will get paid (although it will only take like 15 minutes), and it will be kind of fun, to boot.
                We can do this if we're on shift together, or any time that works for you guys. 

                Email/text me and we'll set something up.

                Best,

                --
