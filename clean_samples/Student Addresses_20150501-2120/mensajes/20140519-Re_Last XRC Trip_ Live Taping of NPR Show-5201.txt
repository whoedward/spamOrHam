Thanks,

We'll be part of the audience of a live recording, and the panelists (people like Mo Rocca and Neko Case) and call-in guests (last year it was Nancy Pelosi) are always pretty sassy and entertaining.

It's also one of my favorite NPR shows (after This American Life and Radiolab), which should obviously be the main selling point.

You can pay me in person (we can arrange a meet) or you can put the cash or check (to Northwestern university) in an envelope with your name under my door.
