Annual Survey

Hey Ethan, take the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee's Annual Survey to help improve Northwestern and for the chance to win one of many great prizes. Prizes this year include:

    $50 Amazon gift card
    A football signed by Fitz
    1 free Subway sandwich every week of winter quarter

Your survey responses will help form proposals that the UBPC presents directly to the President and Provost of the University. To improve the Northwestern experience for all, these proposals will cover important campus issues such as mental health resources, research grants, building community, Saferide and more. Please help the UBPC accurately measure student priorities by spending 12-15 minutes filling out this survey.
