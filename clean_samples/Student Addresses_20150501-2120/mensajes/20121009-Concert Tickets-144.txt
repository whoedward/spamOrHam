Hey guys,

A few NU students who are doing promotional work with NBC and their new film The Man with the Iron Fist have contacted me asking if anyone would like to go to a concert featuring RZA, Supernatural, and etc. this Saturday. It's a pretty sweet opportunity.

They have two free tickets available and have reached out to us since we're a martial arts club.

Here's a link with more info on the concert.

Let me know if you would be interested by Thursday so I can give them your names and emails. Hope some of us get to go.

Ann
