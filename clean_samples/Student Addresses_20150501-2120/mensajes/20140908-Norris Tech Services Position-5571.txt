Hi Greer,

I'm one of the Norris Tech Services supervisors, and am pleased to welcome you to the NTS team!

We'd like to get you started here as soon as possible, if that works for you.

If you are available, any dates from September 15th through the 24th (09/15/2014 - 09/24/2014) would be excellent for an opportunity to train you on all of the skills that you'll need for the position.

Please let me know if any of these days work for you.If not, please let us know what does work.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

--
