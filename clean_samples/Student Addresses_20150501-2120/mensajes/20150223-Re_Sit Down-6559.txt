    Hi Chen,

    Sorry for the late response, but I have a formal dinner tonight; when are you free during the week?

        Hey Ethan,

        Can you do sometime between 6pm-midnight on Sunday again? I'll be on shift then.

        Best,
        Chen

            Hi Chen,

            Just wondering if you have any time over the next week to sit down for about fifteen minutes and talk. It can be while you're on shift or otherwise. Let me know your availability.

            Regards,
