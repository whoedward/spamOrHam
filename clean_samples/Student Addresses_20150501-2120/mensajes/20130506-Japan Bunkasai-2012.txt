Hello everyone,

I sent out a message a while ago about the this, but I though I would check one more time.

As of now a few of us will be demonstrating some Judo and BJJ techniques at the Japan club's Bunkasai this coming Sunday 5/12 at 6:00om. If you are interested in doing this with us, let me know because we need to meet sometime this week to go over the techniques we will demonstrate. There will be free Japanese food and other performances so it should be really fun!

Let me know if you are interested,

Jacob
