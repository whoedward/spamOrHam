Hello Professor Coddens,

I hope that you are having an excellent break so far! I just wanted to email you to find out how I might go about discovering my grade on the final exam. If you have it, I would be happy to hear it from you; if it's someplace obvious, if you could just point me in the right direction, that would be great, too. I apologize if I missed an email/announcement that explained the process or anything like that.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
