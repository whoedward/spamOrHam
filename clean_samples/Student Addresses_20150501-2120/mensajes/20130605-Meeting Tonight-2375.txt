Hi NTS,

If you haven't seen Michael's email yet, we're having our meeting tonight from 7-8pm in the Casbah room. This the last meeting of the year, so if you have any conflicts during Finals week, make sure you either attend the meeting or send it in to ntssupervisors@gmail.com so we can get it covered.

Thanks,

Alex
