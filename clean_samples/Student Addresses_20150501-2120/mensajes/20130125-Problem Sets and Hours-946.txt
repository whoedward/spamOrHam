Hello Karna,

I am emailing you in regards to the problem sets and the difficulty that I have with them. I have little to no difficulty understanding the in-class content (although sometimes the daily questions throw me for a bit of a loop); however, it seems that as soon as I open up E&P I lose all foundation, and I suddenly have no idea what I am doing. I am emailing you both to ask you to please forgive me for the poor job that I have done on this week's assignment and to ask about a specific topic.
Integration itself is relatively simple (if I couldn't integrate, I wouldn't be in this class), but I so far fail to understand how to find new intervals, change coordinates, etc. If you are available, I would like to go over this week's homework along with several problems from last week's homework. Ideally, I would like to meet with you before Thursday. Are there any days on which you are available? If so, at what times?

Thank you for your patience,
Ethan Robison
