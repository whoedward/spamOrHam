Hey all,

We've got a couple tournaments this April to look forward to.

On April 12th: Indy Cup in Indianapolis (3.5 hrs away)
This will be a sparring-only tournament, and everyone will compete with Daedo Truescore.

April 19: Chicago Open Taekwondo Championship (40 min away)
There will be Sparring and Poomse. Daedo Truescore sparring for black belts only. And they're saying ALL referees are going to be USAT-certified! 

Let's start getting ready for these! I highly recommend we go to one of these, most likely the Chicago one.

I'll see you soon!
Andrew
