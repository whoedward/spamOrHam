Hey guys,

We're having a design review for the Baja team tomorrow 6-9.  This may be a recurring issue, but I'll do my best to balance the two.  We're still finalizing a weekly meeting time for Baja, can I go ahead and assume we will continue meeting Wednesday evenings for NTS?

Thanks,

Will

    Hi everyone,

    We're having our meeting from 7-8pm in the Casbah Room tomorrow. If you're a new hire, drop on by, introduce yourself and we'll get you scheduled as well. If you don't know where the Casbah room is, the room next to the ping pong table in the Game room.

    If you can't make the meeting, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason by noon tomorrow.

    Thanks,
