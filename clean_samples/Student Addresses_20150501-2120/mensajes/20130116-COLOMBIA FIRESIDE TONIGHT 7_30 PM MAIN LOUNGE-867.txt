Hey guys,

Just a friendly reminder:

Tonight, Prof. Safford will give a fireside on "Colombia: Historical Context and Current Issues" at 7:30 PM in the ISRC main lounge. 

Before that, we will meet for Academic and Fellow Committee Meeting at 7 PM in the main lounge. So come hangout with us and get points ! 

See you then,
Arkar
