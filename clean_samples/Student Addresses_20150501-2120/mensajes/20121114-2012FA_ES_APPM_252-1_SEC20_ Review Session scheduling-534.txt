The results are in! It's not perfect, but it looks like this Friday, from 6-8pm, is the best time. I'll plan to be in M453 then, to go over any topics that are causing trouble. If this time doesn't work for you, feel free to contact me to schedule a one-on-one appointment.

Also, in case you missed my brief announcement this morning, please note that there will be no recitation next Wednesday morning (before Thanksgiving).
