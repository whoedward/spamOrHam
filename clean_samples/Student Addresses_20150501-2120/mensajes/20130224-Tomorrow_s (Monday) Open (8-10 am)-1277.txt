Good evening, NTS!

Happy cramming, I hope?  Stay warm and sane, please.

Some circumstances came up for one of our fellow staffers regarding a shift tomorrow morning--would anyone be willing to cover Monday's open on the fly?  It would be greatly and wholly appreciated.

With all due respect,

Marina W.
