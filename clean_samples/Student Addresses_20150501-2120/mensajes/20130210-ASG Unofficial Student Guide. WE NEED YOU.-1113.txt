Hi everyone!

I am helping put together an unofficial student guide for ASG that will be up and running by the end of this year, and hey, you're some of the first people to know about it. 

We need help composing the section on courses and faculty. If you wouldn't mind, we'd love it if you could write up a little blurb that includes interesting information or stories about faculty or courses. I would really appreciate it! You can give any advice on what classes you think students should take, which professors are awesome, or other stories that you think people would find useful.

Really, anything even mildly related to classes.

Any feedback can be entered in this form:

You'll be famous.


Thanks!
