Here are some things to do with your families:

    Dine in Downtown Evanston
    Take the CTA and visit Chicago
    Show them Millenium Park, try some ethnic food(at restaurants in neighborhoods such as Chinatown and Pilsen), or go downtown
    Go to one of the shopping centers around the Chicagoland area
    Show them where your classes are and other places on campus
    Take pictures with your family in front of Deering and other beautiful buildings
    Hang out at ISRC
    Go to the football game
    Go to some shows/productions on campus

And if you're not hanging out with your parents, you can do the following this with me and anyone else who wants to have FUN:
