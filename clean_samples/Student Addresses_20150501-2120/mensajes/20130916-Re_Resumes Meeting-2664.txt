        Hello Fellow Supervisors, 

        Hope everyone's week is off to a great start! I was talking with Michael today, and I want to set up a time for us to meet and discuss applications and resumes we've received and who we want to interview as far as hiring people for this quarter. Possibly we could meet before or after our all-staff meeting on Friday night? Other then that, I'm available tomorrow or Wednesday afternoon if those times work better. Let me know what works for you. Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow night for Norris at Night!
