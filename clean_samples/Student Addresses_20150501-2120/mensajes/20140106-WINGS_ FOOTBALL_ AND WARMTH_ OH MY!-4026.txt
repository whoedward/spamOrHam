Hey lovely residents!,

If you're not back yet, I'm sorry you are still at home and I hope your flights are working out somewhat well, especially since we don't have class tomorrow!!

If you are back and bored out of your mind, there's this kinda important football game that may or may not be playing tonight. It goes by the name of the BCS championship bowl. I don't know if you've heard of it, but we're going to celebrate this game with a shindig involving food. 

specifically WINGS.

So if you would like to join us, we'll be in the 1st floor lounge at 7:15 with the game starting at 7:30

Stay warm,
Exec and CAs
