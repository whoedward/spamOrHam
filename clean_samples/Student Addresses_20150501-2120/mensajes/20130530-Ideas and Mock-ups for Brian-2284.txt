Hello Dean Holtgreive,

Evan and I were discussing options for implementing your automated idea in our project, and we made an appreciable amount of progress. We would like to discuss these with you tomorrow some time if you are available. We should both be available any time in the afternoon, although the specifics are vague.

Please feel free to reply to this email as opposed to calling me personally; I simply wanted to find out if you were in your office.

If you need any more information, please feel free to ask.

Best,
Ethan Robison and the Members of Team Three
