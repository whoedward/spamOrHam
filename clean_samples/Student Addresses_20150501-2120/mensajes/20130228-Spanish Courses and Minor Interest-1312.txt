Hello Professor Chung,

My name is Ethan Robison, and I am a student in the McCormick school of engineering interested in pursuing a minor in Spanish language. However, due to scheduling conflicts, I have been yet unable to participate in any of the numerous courses that Weinberg offers in the language. Fortunately, I do have the opportunity of having some freedom in my schedule this upcoming quarter (Spring 2013). Unfortunately, the number and variety of Spanish courses offered at this time is greatly limited relative to those offered in the Fall quarter, or even the Winter quarter.
I am emailing to ask you for any information that you might have concerning placement into courses that might require special permission. If I have made a mistake in contacting you, I apologize, and ask politely for your help in finding the correct member of faculty to assist me.
I am interested in taking Spanish 201-0: Conversation on Human Rights: Latin America. I am under the impression that this class will be beneficial to my knowledge of the language, and that it is a prerequisite for many advanced courses.

If there is any more information that I can provide for you, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
