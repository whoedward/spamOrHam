Michael,

I considered the possibility that it might have been a connection issue, but it persisted with the laptop that the presenter was using and with one of NTS's laptops. Additionally, the HDMI cord that I connected to both of aforementioned computers worked fine.

Our laptop was one of the new Windows computers. The laptop that the presenter was using was also a Windows computer.

Hopefully this helps.

    Hello Michael,

     

    Thank you for notifying us of this issue.  Someone was sent down to check out the podium VGA connection.  The test was successful.  We were also able to speak with a professor who had just used the room and they did not experience any issues.  Do you happen to know what type of laptop the presenter was trying to connect with.? Perhaps it could have been an issue with an adapter, or a resolution incompatibility.  Any additional information would be greatly appreciated.

     

    All the Best,

    Hello,

    We had an issue with the VA cable at the Lectern this weekend.  Please see below for additional details.

     

    Thanks,

    Hello Michael,

     

    I am emailing you because the VGA cable at the Ryan auditorium podium is not working properly. It cuts in and out when plugged into laptops.

     

    Note that I mean the VGA cable from the mobile podium, not the VGA at the desk with the resident computer.

     

    If you need any additional information, please let me know.

     

    Thanks,

    Ethan
