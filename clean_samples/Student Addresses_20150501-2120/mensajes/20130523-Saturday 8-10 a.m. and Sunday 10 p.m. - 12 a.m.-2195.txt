Hey guys,

Something has come up and I need my Saturday open and Sunday close covered because I am headed out of town this weekend.
They're both super laid back shifts (I sleep most Saturdays from 8:15 until 10:00) and easy enough.

If anyone covers these I will owe him/her/them big time.
Sorry it's so last minute!

Best,
Ethan
