Hello,

So, as you might have noticed, I failed to show up tonight...
 I really hope that the shift was a dull, simple one and that you were not inconvenienced in any way.
 Part of me wants to say that I'm not used to the new schedule, but I still should have been there.
I'm incredibly sorry, and you can count on me showing up from now on.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
