Haven't received any replies, and I'm still feeling pretty sick, so I thought I'd try sending this one more time.  If you can help, I and my sinuses would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Ryan

Hey,

So I woke up this morning, and I seem to have come down with a bit of the flu.  In my experience it usually takes 2-3 days for me to get over these things, so I was wondering if anybody would be willing to take my shifts for tomorrow.

I'm scheduled to work from 10am-6pm.  If you can take all or some of these hours, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Ryan
