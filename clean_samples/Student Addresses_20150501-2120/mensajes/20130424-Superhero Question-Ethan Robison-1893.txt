Hello Michael,

In response to the superhero question: I would like to have the power of telekinesis. Telekinesis, the ability to move things from a distance, has all of the typical advantages of being "super-" strength, speed, flight, etc., plus a few extras. Any heavy object could be lifted with one's mind, One could simply lift one's body from the ground and move it around at any speed. Additionally, as the advent of invisibility technology approaches, it has been demonstrated that making ourselves disappear could be a matter of manipulating the material through which light passes so that it seems that we are invisible. This would be a simple matter if one were focused enough. These are the sorts of powers that "average" superheros have.

In addition to these, a sufficiently skilled telekinetic could use his/her powers to manipulate the molecules and photons in the surroundings to generate heat, electricity, x-rays, or anything of the sort (okay, actually generating x-rays would not grant x-ray vision, but it's a start). With this sort of skill and sufficient mental fortitude, a telekinetic could control a whole host of superpowers with simply his/her mind.

In short, telekinesis is the sort of super power that I would like because it allows a smorgasbord of abilities and only requires that one have the mental capacity to maintain one's focus.

In terms of names, Neuro, Psionico, or any sort of "thought" related moniker would be adequate and appropriate. As a side note: "Psychico" would be a stupendous name as it would be a play on words of Psychic-o and Psy-chico (chico is the Spanish word for boy).

Thanks for your time,
Ethan
