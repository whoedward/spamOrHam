Hi Mary,

I am an Evanston Living tenant in 2213 Ridge 2B.

Since Winter Quarter is coming around for NU, we have two more residents who will be moving into the apartment. As such, is there a process for getting extra sets of keys for our residence? If there is, please let me know what I need to do.

Thank you in advance,
Ethan Robison & Co.
