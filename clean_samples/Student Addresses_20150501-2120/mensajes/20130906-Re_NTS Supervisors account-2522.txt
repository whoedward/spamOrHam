The username to the Google account is ntssupervisors@gmail.com and the password is N0rr15$$!!5uper5. I've added everyone's name to the forwarding thing but you need to click the verification link first.

    Hey Alex,

     

    I was wondering what the username & password for NTS supervisors account because I have to upload the manuals/brochures to the google drive on that account. 

     

    Thanks!

     

    Phoebe
