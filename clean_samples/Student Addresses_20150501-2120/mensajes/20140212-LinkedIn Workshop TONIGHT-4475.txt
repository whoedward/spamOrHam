Do you know what LinkedIn is? Do you have a LinkedIn profile? Do you know all the cool functions that LinkedIn has? 

University Career Services once taught me how to track down all the alums of Northwestern who are in the field that I want to work in. It was mind blowing! Being familiar with LinkedIn allows you to network with alums and potential employers, set up informational interviews and target your dream jobs!

Come learn about LinkedIn from University Career Services at 7pm on Wednesday February 12th TONIGHT in CRC main lounge. Dessert will be served.

Flyer is attached for more information.
