Try to bring it earlier, if it isn't too much trouble for the two of you to arrange that. We can Venmo Mike if need be (just let us know, dog).

    Sorry for the late response! I am on board. Do I need to Venmo someone?
    As for what I can contribute, I haven't updated the list yet, but I have:
    -flatscreen tv + vcr cabinet thing
    -pots and pans and baking sheets
    -kitchen utensils + cookware
    -eating utensils
    -four plates
    -four glasses
    -Good Housekeeping cookbook
    -dish towels
    -lamp
    -wastebasket
    -electric coffee maker
    I can either bring these things in August if Mike has room to store them.
    Or: my mom can bring these things the week of September 8 or the following week.
    So, Mike, lmk if you have space (I can send you a picture of how much space this stuff takes up.)
