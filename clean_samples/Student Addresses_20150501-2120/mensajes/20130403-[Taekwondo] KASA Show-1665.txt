Hello everyone,

First things first, if you are planning to be in the KASA Show demo this year, I need to know ASAP. Please reply to this email so I can get a clear head count.

The KASA Show is Friday, May 3rd. That gives us 4 Saturday practices to prepare. If you plan to be in the show, I need you to be at all four of those practices. Let me know if you have any conflicts with practice times.

The fourth Saturday practice, the one on April 27th, will be slightly different. Instead of meeting at Blomquist and practicing there, we will be at Tech Auditorium for a dress rehearsal that day. I will give you guys more info about that particular dress rehearsal as I receive the information about it.

Finally, there is a demonstration for Kellogg next Friday afternoon on April 12th. We will spend the coming Saturday practice to prepare something simple for that and perform that Friday. Please let me know if you might have conflicts for the Kellogg demonstration.

P.S. We're planning to watch Iron Man 3 as soon as we finish the KASA Show demo.
