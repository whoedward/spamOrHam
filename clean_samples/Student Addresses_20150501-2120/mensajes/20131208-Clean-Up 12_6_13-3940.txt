Hey Guys,

This is an email concerning clean-up on Friday night (12/6/13). When I got in on Saturday, I found a microphone left out in the Big Ten room. Please be sure to double check all of the rooms for NTS equipment, especially valuable pieces like mics.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or any of the other supers.

Regards,
Ethan
