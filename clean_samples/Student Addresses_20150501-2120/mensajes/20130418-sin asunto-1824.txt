Hey Cheryl,

I wanted to email you to let you know that there is payment for my and Maddie's ticket under your door. I also wanted to let you know that I by accident slipped forty dollars under your door instead of twenty (turns out, they feel the same). Whenever you would like, Maddie or I could stop by your office to grab the extra cash. Thanks!

Best,
Ethan
