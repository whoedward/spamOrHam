Dear Max,
         Today, you missed your second shift, from 10am-12pm. This has become a problem, as this is your second missed shift in only this quarter. The supers would like an explanation for this recurring behavior.

Your first warning was on November 13th. This is notice of your second warning, and a written final warning notice will be given to you. This will be your final warning. A third warning will result in possible employee termination.

William Hyun
