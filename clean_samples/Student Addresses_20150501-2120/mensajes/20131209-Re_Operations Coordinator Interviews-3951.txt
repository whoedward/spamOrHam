    Howdy all,

    I have several candidates scheduled to interview for a new full time evening/weekend position under Event Production. This position will be a behind the scenes supporter of Ops, Tech & Facilities and be able to respond to issues that come up when none of the other full timers are around. They’ll be working with you, but not directly supervising you and your teams. Ultimately, this doesn’t change the roles of our student staffs, my hope is that it provides much better support for you in the moment and enhances our ability to meet client demand.

     

    Anyway, I want to make sure the candidate we hire is a good fit for our student employees. So I’m asking if a couple of you might be available tomorrow at 1pm to sit in and get to know our first candidate.

     

    Please respond with interest,

     

    Dan
