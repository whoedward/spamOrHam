Good morning, NTS!

I realize life is getting hectic with the first round of our 5 to the xth midterms coming around, but as I myself have a midterm in my 10 am Japanese class Friday morning, I was wondering if anybody would be good enough to cover this shift so I could study and rest up for it.  I would be eternally (eternally) grateful.  Meanwhile, study hard, play hard!

Thanks,

Marina
