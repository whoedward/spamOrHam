Heeeeeeeeeeeey...

First, I'm really sorry about this one; I should have remembered at the meeting, but I didn't.  So my roommate's been rehearsing for the opera (L'Incoronazione di Poppea) for the last few months, and there are only two performances: Friday night and Saturday night.

I know this isn't a hard obligation for me, but I did promise him I'd go.  Would it be possible for somebody to either take my Friday rotation or the 8:30-11:30pm portion of the Ryan Event on Saturday?  I'd really rather not miss this.

Sorry about this; I know everybody's busy.

Ryan
