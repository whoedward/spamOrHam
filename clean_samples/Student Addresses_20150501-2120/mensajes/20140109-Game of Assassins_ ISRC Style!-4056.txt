Hey everyone!

Things around here are quiet, a bit too quiet for my tastes. Therefore, I will be hosting an ISRC game of assassins! If you are interested in joining the game, please fill out a row in the attached spreadsheet. Type in your name, your room number, and what type of gift card you would like IF you were to win the game.

Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av4OS4eBjonVdGx0SXVUT2dLQll0UmFPc2E5NGt2bXc&usp=sharing

Sign-ups will close by Friday, January 17 at 9pm.

Rules will be sent out later once the sign-up is complete, but I will tell you one thing: weapons will be water pistols provided by exec.

Join in on the fun!
Thomas
