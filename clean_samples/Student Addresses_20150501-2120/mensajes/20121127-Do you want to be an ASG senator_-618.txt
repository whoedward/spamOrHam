Hello Best Fairchildren!

Pleas email me if you would be interested in becoming a senator in ASG for ISRC!
You will have a big impact on campus and will be involved within Northwestern in ways that are not possible through other groups. You'll get a better understanding of what goes on at Northwestern and in Spring, you'll play a part in allocating 1.2 million dollars of funding.

Cheers,
SB
