Friends! Countrymen! Lend me your ear...

As Ji-Hoon's email just said, testing is on Wednesday. Even if you aren't testing you can show up and support those who are. 

Additionally, I'm not going to be around too much in the fall due to marching band, so to make my life easier (and your's too) I'd like to make a little database of everyone in the club, so if you could please send me an email with your name and year at Northwestern, that would greatly help me out with collecting dues in the future.

Thanks!

Joanna
