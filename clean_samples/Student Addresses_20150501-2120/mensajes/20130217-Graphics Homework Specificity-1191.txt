Hello Dean Holtgreive,

The members of Team Four and I were discussing the specifics of the upcoming graphics homework (due this Tuesday) and we were wondering about the nature of dimensioning a chair Are we making arbitrary dimensions and maintaining internal consistency or are we supposed to use some sort of physical characteristic of the drawing to determine the measurements?

Thank you for your time,
Team Four
