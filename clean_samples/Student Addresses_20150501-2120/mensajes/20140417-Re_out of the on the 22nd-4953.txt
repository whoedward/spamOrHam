    He folks,

    I was going over the schedule and saw an out of house on the 22nd from 330pm-7pm.  Anyone know what this one is?  I’m not seeing any7thing in sheets or AV board.  There’s a set-up on the 23rd for the morning of the 24th in the Great Room. 

     

    Let me know if you know something that I don’t know!
