Tis the season of LOVE! We're celebrating here at Norris by sending each other valentines. Each department will receive a mailbox to decorate (the best decorated box will win points for their department!!) and some blank valentines.

Fill out a valentine, writing in the recipient's name, department, and a heartfelt message. These valentines can go to students, pro-staffers, your favorite Starbucks employee, or anyone else who works at Norris. Sign your valentine, or leave it anonymous. Now's the chance to send some love from a secret admirer! Drop your filled out valentines into the outbox at the INFO DESK. We'll pick them up, attach a piece of candy, and deliver the valentine to the recipient's department.

VALENTINES MUST BE PLACED IN THE OUTBOX BY FEBRUARY 13 AT 5PM FOR VALENTINES DELIVERY.

Spread the love, Norris!
