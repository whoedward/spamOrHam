Hey Supers,

So as you know, I really need to get my shift covered tomorrow because I need to go to TA office hours because I can't do my homework... Since nobody took the shift, I just asked if Will can handle it on his own just this once (it's usually a really chill shift) and he agreed. Hope that's okay!

Best,
Nelson

    Hey Will,

    I really need to go to TA office hours tomorrow this one time, do you think you can handle the shift by yourself just this one time?

    Thanks,
