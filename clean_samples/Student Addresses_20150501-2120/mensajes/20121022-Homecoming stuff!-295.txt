Hey everyone,

Two things:

1) We are painting the homecoming banner this Thursday at 6pm at Artica. Let me know if you are interested in helping with that.

2) The Homecoming parade is this Friday! We check in at 5pm so we will meet in the main lounge at 4:45. Come support ISRC and walk with us!

Best,

Robbie
