Hi everyone,
Here are the notes from yesterday's meeting,
Announcements:
There will be a Norris Staff party Friday, March 14th starting at 4:30pm. We encourage everyone to attend - there will be lots of food/prizes.

We will contact everyone about going over their mid-year evaluations soon - the entire process shouldn't take more than 20 minutes.

If you want to apply to be a supervisor next year make sure to keep an eye out for the Norris Leadership Search, which should start up soon.

If you are on an out-of-house shift, make sure you are filling out a shiftlog after your shift - this is for us to make sure everything went properly.
