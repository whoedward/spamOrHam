    What up techs,

    It turns out there are two out of house events this weekend that we missed.

    There's a swing dance event this Saturday (tomorrow) from 5:30 - 8 PM that we would like at least one extra tech on (two if possible). If you are a new hire, I strongly reccomend you come because we will be setting up a fairly complicated audio setup, and this is a great learning experience! Tim Perian and I will both be there for different parts of the event, so we'll make it as stress-free as possible.

    Theres also the Color Roar this Sunday from noon to 3 PM. It's a more chill setup on Deering Meadow, and we'd like to have an extra on board.

    Please respond to this message and let us know if you're available. #tbt
