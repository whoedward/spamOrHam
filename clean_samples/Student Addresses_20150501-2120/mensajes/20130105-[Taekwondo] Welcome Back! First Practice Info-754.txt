Hey everyone,

I hope you've enjoyed the holidays and are ready for the new quarter. The first practice will be on my birthday. Since I'm sure eeeeeeeeverybody knows when that is, I'll save myself the trouble of including the specific date in this email. Just be sure to show up at Blomquist at 8 PM that day. :)

Kallo won't be here until Wednesday, and we'll be spending Monday practice to get back into gear and work off all those holiday cookies and New Year's beer bellies. For those of you who tested last quarter, the belt ceremony will be on Wednesday during practice.

See you all on my birthday,
Ji-hoon

P.S. Monday, January 7th. :P
