Hey guys,

The tentative schedule for the quarter is up on Shiftplanning - its effective starting tomorrow, but we only need one person per shift tomorrow.
If you have any conflicts/complaints for shifts before Wednesday, send them out on the listserv and put them up for trade on Shiftplanning, otherwise we'll sort it out at the meeting on Wednesday

See you soon,

Alex
Hi everyone,

The first version of the winter schedule is up on shiftplanning - if you have any conflicts/complaints email me and I'll work it out.

Thanks,
