Hey ISRCers,

For this week IFN, we'll be watching "To Live (Huozhe)"(http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/huozhe-to-live-lifetimes-living/) , a Chinese epic film directed by Zhangyi Mou ( the director of Hero), starring Gong Li. This extraordinarily moving film follows a contemporary Chinese family across the turbulent year of Modern China, from 1940s to 1970s. It received various critical claims, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for the Best Foreign Language Film in 1994. 

So, come enjoy this great movie onThursday at 8PM in the basement and get Academic Points !

Best,
Arkar
