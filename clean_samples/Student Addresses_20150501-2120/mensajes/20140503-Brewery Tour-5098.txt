Hi everyone!

On May 17th we have organized a trip to the Church St. Brewery around 1PM in Itasca (about 40 mins away). Please fill out this form if you would like to go - the brewery is expecting 10-15 people, so there is a chance we will have to cut off the number of attendees so sign up soon!

Few things about the trip: 
You don't have to be over 21, but you can't taste any beer if you are not.
There is no charge for tours. But tastings are $1, pints are $5, growlers are $12 to $15 and the glass growler is $6.
Tours would be about 1/2 hour, but depend on how many questions you all ask.

Thanks,

Alex
