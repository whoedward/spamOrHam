Hey Jenn,

Sorry to keep emailing you. Deanna Aburaad is one of our new hires who has worked here now for several weeks. She submitted her paperwork, but has not yet been able to swipe in. Additionally, the list that you sent us of all of NTS employees does not include her as having or not having her Work Study form. What is it that we should do to take care of this?

I just wanted to check in with you on this, and, again, sorry to fill up your inbox.

Best,
