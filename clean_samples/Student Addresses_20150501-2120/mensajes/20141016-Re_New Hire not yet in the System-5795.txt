    Hi Ethan,

     

    Evan is one of the people whose paperwork is not processed. I have a ton of them, so thanks for letting me know youâ€™re keeping track. I will follow up with Payroll!

    Hi Jenn,

     

    I am emailing becaause Evan, one of our new hires, is unable to swipe in. He completed and returned his paperwork several weeks ago.

     

    Is there anything that he (or anyone on NTS) needs to do to take care of this process? If so, please let us know how it is that we can resolve this.

     

    Thanks in advance for your help,
