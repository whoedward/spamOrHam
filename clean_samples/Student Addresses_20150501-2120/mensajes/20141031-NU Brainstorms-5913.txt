Do you want to improve the Northwestern experience with a $500,000 initiative? Do you want to ask a question to all of Northwestern? Do you want a chance to win one of 5 $20 amazon giftcards? Then participate in NU Brainstorms, a quick two question survey to help inform ASG survey formation and decision making.
 
NU Brainstorms is a joint effort between ASG and UBPC in an attempt to improve the question making process for the school wide winter survey. We will gather feedback from this brainstorm and this winter we will ask the questions you think are important. So definitely fill it out below!
