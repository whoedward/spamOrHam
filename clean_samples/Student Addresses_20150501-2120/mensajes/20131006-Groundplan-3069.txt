I got y'all a present. It's not final, and the dimensions will probably change, but that's a very general idea of the set right now. Frank and I are working on some stuff thematically, and I need to set up a meeting with Scott some time this week to talk about what he's envisioning (Pernell, do you want in on that?) so we can go from there.

The stage right door will be isolated from the other walls, but will have a floating chair rail on either side so actors won't be able to go between it and the back wall. There will also be some furniture in there, I need to look through the script again to tally up just how much we need though. That's all very flexible right now, so do what makes sense to you guys in the room and I can work with that furniture-wise.

Let me know if you need anything else, I'm in Mancha tech but it'll calm down as the week goes on.

Best,
Nikolaj
