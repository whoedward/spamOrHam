Hey everyone!

So far, I have 3 petitions from wonderful people who are running for the vacant positions on exec. Right now, we have no one running for the all-important position of PHILANTHROPY CHAIR.

The latest I will accept petitions will be this Friday, April 17, by 9:00 pm.

Thanks everyone, and enjoy a silly cat! :3
