    Hey everyone,
    I recently had an injury and would really prefer not to work my Monday open this week, which is an early open at 7:30am.  I understand this is probably the least appealing shift to want to cover, but I would really not feel up to it.  Please let me know if you're able and willing to cover this.  It's just the 7:30-10am shift.  Thanks guys.

    Alex
