Hey guys,

Just a reminder. There will be CRC-ISRC Presidential Debate Gathering starting from 8PM in CRC main lounge. That will be the final Presidential Debate focusing on Foreign Policy. Prof. David Zarefsky, a dean of the School of Communication and one of the nationâ€™s leading experts on presidential rhetoric and debates, will lead a discussion afterward.

Best,
Arkar
