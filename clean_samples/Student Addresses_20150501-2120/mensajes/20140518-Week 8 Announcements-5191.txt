Hey guys,

Hope you guys are all pulling through as the year comes to an end. Just a few announcements:

1) Practices will now return to normal, now that the KASA Show is over. Thanks once again for your understanding during the past month.

2) No practices this Saturday and next Saturday. This Saturday, ReFresH has asked me if they could use the space because they apparently have a famous choreographer coming over and can only make that time slot. I figured we should celebrate the end of the KASA Show anyway, so I'm planning on having some kind of nice get-together during that time instead. Stay tuned for that.

And the following Saturday is, of course, Dillo Day.

3) I know that we haven't been emailing about this enough, but club dues are due, so please either give Joanna or me $40 (cash or check made out to Northwestern University). Thank you to all those who have already done so. If you have any questions or concerns regarding dues (i.e. can only make a limited number of practices), please let either Joanna or me know.

See you guys soon,
Davin
