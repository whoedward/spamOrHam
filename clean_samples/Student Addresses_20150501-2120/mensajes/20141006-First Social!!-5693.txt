Hey everyone,
Are you ready for the first social of the year?!
I have plans for 20 people to come get dinner and dessert at Hoosier Mama Evanston, a really wonderful pie shop down by Main street. We would leave ISRC at 5 this coming Sunday, October 12, and get back to ISRC at around 7 though y'all are always free to leave whenever.

I'll send an e-mail this Thursday at 8 PM- the first 20 to respond to that e-mail will get a spot. Those that e-mail afterwards will be put on a waitlist. For this social, those that don't get a spot are more than welcome to join us, as there might be enough food for more. If there's not, the pie is really good and worth the money (imo). We will be walking down, it takes about 30 minutes, we'll all get to know each other and it'll be great. You can take the CTA if you want, but ISRC will not cover that if you so choose (sorry)

So, I'll send an e-mail at 8 pm on Thursday. First 20 to reply get free dinner and dessert!

I'll hear from you guys soon!
Paul Kim
