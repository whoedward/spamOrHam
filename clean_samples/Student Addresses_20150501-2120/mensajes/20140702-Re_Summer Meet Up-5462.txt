I think Cincinnati will work really well. Between my house and Matt's apartment, we'll definitely have room for everyone to sleep. That last weekend of July should work I think. How about for everyone else?

    Indubitably we do!

    So, from what people have said so far, it sounds as though the best weekends to go with would be the final two weekends of July, the 19th-20th and the 26th-27th. The first of those two is rather non-ideal for me, but I could probably swing it if that's what we chose. Final weekend of July works great, though. What do you guys think?

    Also, any additional thoughts on a location?

                Hey Guys,

                The idea of a summer meetup has been thrown around, but let's see if we have some actual interest. So respond with your level of commitment, location preferences, and ideal dates. Also if there is anyone else who I missed and you think would be interested let me know.

                Side note: I found all our locations in latitude and longitude and averaged them to find the "best" place to meet up. And it is ... LIGONIER, INDIANA! (41.444, -85.553)

                Hope your summers are off to a good start,
                Jonas


            I'll add to the resounding chorus of "weekend-only", as I've got a full-time job, but I appear to be available pretty much any weekend.
