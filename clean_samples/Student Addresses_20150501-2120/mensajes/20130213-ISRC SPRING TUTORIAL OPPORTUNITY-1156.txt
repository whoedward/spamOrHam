Rejoice ! One of our fellows, Prof. Andrew Roberts will be offering a tutorial How Journalist Should Use Political Science to Cover Political News for ISRC residents in Spring Quarter. For those of you who are not familiar about tutorial, the following is a basic overview. A tutorial is a small-sized seminar offered ONLY to residents of the RC with which the Fellow or Professor is affiliated. The course time is also flexible to the preferences of students and professors.  This tutorial will be taken place in the ISRC Exec Library, adjunct to the main lounge. 


Also, Prof. Roberts will be coming to ISRC on SUNDAY at 8PM in the Main Lounge to talk about this tutorial and answer any question anyone may have. 



Here is a description of How Journalist Should Use Political Science to Cover Political News.


The aim of this class is to start a dialogue between political scientists and journalists in order to produce better coverage of politics. Though political science research is often dismissed as biased, detached, or worse, in fact the discipline has produced a large body of relatively well-confirmed results about how politics works. The premise of this course is that coverage of politics could be improved if journalists were (i) familiar with this research and (ii) used political scientists as sources in covering politics. This course will explore ways to better cover politics through knowledge of political science.This class will be taught in a discussion format with a variety of guests from the Political Science Department and Medill on issues of their expertise. Each class will feature readings that survey important literatures in political science as well as examples of journalistic coverage of that issue. Students will be challenged to ask whether this coverage takes advantage of what we know about politics and how it could be improved to take advantage of this knowledge.

 

Exercises for students will include the following:

 

-          Writing several articles that cover a current event in the light of political science research

-          Conducting an interview with a political scientist at Northwestern

-          Writing a literature review of a particular subfield of political science.

-          Writing a final paper that proposes ways that journalistic coverage of a particular political issue could be improved by using political science research

-          Class production of a set of tips for journalists and political scientists on how to interact with each other

 

Here are the objectives for the class:

 

-          Students will become familiar with the ways that political scientists study politics.

-          Students will become familiar with some of the main findings of political science research on American and foreign politics.

-          Students will learn how to quickly get themselves up to speed on the academic research in particular subfields of political science.

-          Students will learn how to use academics as sources for journalistic articles.

-          Students will learn how to produce journalism that takes advantage of the latest findings in political science.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions about the tutorial. If you'd like to sign up, email me and I will send the list to Prof. Roberts.
