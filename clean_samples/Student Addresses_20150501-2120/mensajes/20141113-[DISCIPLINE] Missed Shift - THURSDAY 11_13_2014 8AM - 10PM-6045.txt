The two of you were scheduled to work the Thursday open, but showed up late (or not at all). What happened?

You guys are experienced techs, and missing a shift is kind of a big deal, so unless something serious prevented you from showing up, we're going to have to give the both of you a formal warning. Let me know if you have any questions.

From,
Michael Wang
