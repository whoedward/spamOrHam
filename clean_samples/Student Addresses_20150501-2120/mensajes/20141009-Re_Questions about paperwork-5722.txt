Hi Deanna,

Sorry to respond so late about this. You can talk to Jenn Stripe about these questions. I have her as a CC for this email, so feel free to get in touch with her. In addition, I believe that a lot of this stuff will be covered in Onboarding/Orientation, although I do not know when that will start for you guys.

Best,
Ethan

    Hello!

    I am done with the new employee paperwork but have a question regarding the IL-W-4. Since this is a work-study job, am I exempt from federal and Illinois Income Tax withholding? In addition, how do I use self-service to sign up for a direct deposit of my payroll?
    I will be at the meeting tomorrow night if it is easier to go over these questions then.

    See you tomorrow,
    Didi Aburaad
