Hey everyone,

Here are the events for ISRC this week:

Fireside: Thomas on the Points System in the Main Lounge combined with MUNCHIES from 1-Blue (Italy)

IFN: "Old Boy" a Korean movie

Philanthropy:
1. Book Buddies at EPL this Friday from 3:30-5:00. Email Diamanta Panford ASAP (jumpstartnu@gmail.com)  and CC Ayla if you want to do it!
2. Email Ayla if you registered for the ISRC DM Team!
3. Watch out for 3 DM fundraising events coming up in November (details on these events will come up in future emails as the events start next week) 

Reimbursements: Please give your receipts to Victor if you bought something for the dorm because he can only reimburse in a 3-4 week period after purchase!

Attached are the notes for Open Exec this week.

Happy Monday,
Rohan
