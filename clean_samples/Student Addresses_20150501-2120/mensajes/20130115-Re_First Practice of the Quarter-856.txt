Hey everybody,

This has nothing to do with anything that will be going on NUBJJ, but I just wanted to ask:

Is there anybody who would be interested in learning a martial art called "wushu?" If you don't know what it is, here's a video I found. The music's kinda annoying but it get's the point across:

Let me know what you think,

    Hello everyone,

    I am Sean McGinnis and I am going to be running BJJ practices Wednesdays at 8 over at blomquist, starting tomorrow.
    I hope everyone that wants to go can make it, we will be reviewing the Triangle Choke from guard, and then I will teach everyone my favorite submission, the Triangle Choke from mount.

    Hope to see you there,
    Sean

        Hello!

        The first practice of the quarter will be this Saturday at Blomquist 2-4pm. 
        We're going to review some basic concepts and learn some attacks from the back.
        We will also be discussing a possible mid-week practice and t-shirts.

        Hope to see you all there!
        Jacob
