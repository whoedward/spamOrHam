> Gotcha! I found it thanks:) However, I don't think my trade with Magan was updated on shift planning yet. So for now I'll still ask by email? Is there anyone else who can cover for me? thanks guys!

>> Sorry, I have rehearsal so I can't cover your shift, but on ShiftPlanning you can request a trade by going to your upcoming shifts list (on your homepage there should be a column on the right hand side that lists upcoming shifts) and clicking the icon that looks like a piece of paper next to it. From there, you can select "trade shift" and ask people to cover for you via ShiftPlanning. Hope this helps!
