Also, it's my birthday today and as they say, it is better to give than receive. And I would love nothing more than to GIVE this shift away. Please, this would be a great birthday present so I can spend time with some friends tonight.

Happy St. Patty's Day everyone,

Matt

    Hey NTS,

    I was wondering if someone would be able to take my 10 p.m. to midnight shift tonight. I've got a final tomorrow morning and would like to sleep as much as possible.

    Thanks,

    Matt
