Alrighty,

This should do the trick. Almost everything is implemented, and, as far as I know, everything works without a hitch.
Check it out. If you have anything that you want to change, go for it (or I can do it, if you want).

Cheers,
Ethan

    Hey guys,

    This meets all of the criteria for the assignment. There are a few additions that could definitely be made, and I'm going to ask him about them after class, but there aren't any terrible standouts. So, if everyone's cool with it, I'll go ahead and submit it.
