Hey guys,

If you are craving a Norris polo because either you can't find your old one or you just love Norris enough to want more apparel then swing by the Admin office in the next few days! A brand new shipment came in last week and now hundreds of shirts are up for grabs for student and pro-staff. We have all sizes (ladies small-3XL).

If you are new staff then you should definitely come by so you can pick up a purple staff polo AND this year's Norris at Night T-shirt.

Best,
~Carmen M.
