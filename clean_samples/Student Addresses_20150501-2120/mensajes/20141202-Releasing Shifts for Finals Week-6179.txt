Hi NTS:

1. Tomorrow is our last meeting of the quarter, in Wildcat A, 7-8pm. 
NOTE: You are responsible for fall quarter shifts until Friday, December 12th, 6pm. Any shifts before this time you must get covered. 

2. Please release all of the shifts you need covered by noon on Wednesday thru shiftplanning. 

3. If you cannot make the meeting, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason.

4. If you would like to work at NTS over winter break, please notify the email above or tell the supervisors at the meeting tomorrow. We do need at least 1 tech for winter break, preferably more, however. It will come out of your work-study this year. 

5. Norris open 24 hours from December 7-11th for finals. There's free food and other fun activities (see the link)
