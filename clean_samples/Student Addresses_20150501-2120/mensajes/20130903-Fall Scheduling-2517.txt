Hi everyone,

I hope you're enjoying the last few weeks of break. We're getting ready for the school year, so its time to fill out Fall Classes and Extracurriculars.

Here's the link to the Google Doc:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdGlFUWd6WDJnVkt3b3haN25RSDJKaEE&usp=sharing

Please remember to indicate your preferred shifts with asterisks and try to estimate how many hours you would like to work during the fall. Also, please tell us when you will be able to start working.

Please try to get your schedule into us by Next Monday, September 9th.

See you all in a few weeks!

Alex
