Hi Jake,

We really appreciate you consistently checking in with us about missing meetings due to your other business conflicts. We supers were wondering how long of a conflict this will be though.

The meetings are required as a part of the position and we've been checking in with everyone to make sure that we have as much participation as possible to get shifts covered. 

If this is a conflict recurring indefinitely, we were hoping to negotiate a comprise such as arranging to attend the NTS meetings at least once a month. Please let us know what your commitments will look like going forward and how we can help you meet the requirements for both positions. 

Thanks,
Bobby Ramirez
