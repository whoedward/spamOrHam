Hi everyone,

Sorry to say this, but I have taken another job at a Psychology lab and will no longer be able to work at Norris due to schedule conflicts. I will be able to finish out my schedule through to next Friday. I have already notified Michael and wanted to give you guys a heads up so that you can make adjustments. It has been nice working with you all.

Braelyn H.
