Dear Student:

The Financial Aid Committee is busy preparing for the 2014-2015 academic year and would like to provide you with the instructions for the financial aid reapplication process.

The deadline date for reapplication materials is May 1, 2014. In contrast to your freshman year application, we hope this later date allows you to file your federal income tax returns before submitting the required forms. We will begin releasing financial aid decisions mid-June. Students will receive an email from our office once their award is viewable on CAESAR.

We want to assure you that we will work closely with you through this process and that sufficient resources have been budgeted for all applicants who demonstrate financial need and apply in a timely manner. Below we have outlined the requirements necessary to reapply for federal and institutional assistance.

2014-2015 Financial Aid Reapplication Materials Due May 1, 2014*

I. 2014-2015 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

File electronically at http://www.fafsa.gov

The 2014-2015 FAFSA was available from the Department of Education on January 1 and is used to determine eligibility for federal financial aid, including federal grants and federal student loans. You are encouraged to wait until your 2013 taxes are filed so that you can use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool offered by the Department of Education. This tool allows you to retrieve your tax data directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website and transfer your figures to the FAFSA. The tool may be available to you approximately three weeks after filing your taxes electronically, or eight weeks after Paper filing.If you have already filed your FAFSA, you may update your tax information by returning to the FAFSA website using the link to “Make a correction.” If you wish to only apply for federal student aid, you will only need to submit the FAFSA.

* Illinois residents are encouraged to use estimated tax figures to complete the FAFSA application as early as possible due to limited funding for the State of Illinois MAP Grant program. After your 2013 taxes are filed, you should return to the FAFSA site and use the link to “Make a correction” to update your tax data using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.

II. 2014-2015 College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile

File electronically at http://www.collegeboard.org/profile

The 2014-2015 CSS Profile is currently available from the College Board and is used to determine eligibility for institutional scholarship assistance. Again, you are encouraged to wait until your 2013 taxes are filed before completing the CSS Profile. If you use estimated data, you will not be able to make a correction to your application. Please send any corrections directly to our office.

III. 2014-2015 Northwestern University Aid Application (UAPP)

File electronically on CAESAR via To-Do List: CAESAR > For Students > Financial Services > To Do Item History

Students will be able to access the UAPP through their To-Do List on CAESAR. Parents with guest access to CAESAR will not be able to complete the UAPP. The extracurricular information collected on the UAPP is used to determine eligibility for endowed scholarship assistance.

IV. 2013 Parent(s) W-2 Forms

W-2 Forms can be submitted via fax at (847) 491-5969 or email at undergradaid@u.northwestern.edu. Please be sure to include the student name and Northwestern ID number. If you do not have access to fax or email, you can submit these forms to our office via regular mail.

V. Additional Financial Aid Documentation/ Information

Requested on a case-by-case basis

This could include a request for verification forms, federal tax forms, documentation of a special circumstance (change in income, change in employment), or clarification of reported information. The non-custodial parent will not need to update the NCP Profile unless a special request is made from our office.

Students may access their To-Do List on CAESAR to see if our office has received their application materials. We will review completed files in the order they are received, and students will be notified via email when awards are available to view on CAESAR beginning mid-June. All students who have applied on time will receive an aid decision by the middle of July.

We encourage you to contact our office with questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Financial Aid Committee
Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid
