Hey 4Loko,

Assuming we're still meeting at 3 tomorrow, I'm not sure what we have to talk about. The syllabus is pretty much dead at this point and hasn't been updated.

My best guess for topics to discuss:

Web homework -- Check to see if everyone has done it or understands what to do (I myself may not fall in the latter category)  (10 min)

Deliverables for Tuesday -- Are there any? Discuss. (5 min)

Briefing on Status of Mockups Starting from Friday -- (5-10 min)

Moving Forward -- (25-35 min approx, maybe less)
   Design preferences
   Mockup building schedule, at least for next week or so
   More RAM charts I guess

Any suggestions from any of y'all: I'm stumped for much else and we need to talk about something.

Best,
Will Krinsman
