So it recently came to my attention that I was put on an out of house event from 8pm - 10 pm? I know you guys are trying to rely less on the listserv and more on shiftplanning but I have a reunion to attend today and I'm scared no one is going to respond to my shiftplanning request. 

On that note, if I get placed on a shift without me knowing, would it be possible for you guys to let me know in a more direct manner? The email from shift planning that I got just said "Upcoming schedule is posted" and I didn't think it pertained specifically to me, I thought it was just a reflection of the meeting notes. Now that I know that though, I will be more vigilant in the future but I think it would be helpful to find out via a phone call or text if I'm being randomly assigned a new shift. Because the quicker I know, the better I can arrange my schedule or let you guys know if there are any problems. 

This is less important I guess, but it would also be convenient to know more details about the out-of-house event (maybe as part of the meeting notes?), if only so I know how warmly to dress or whether or not I can bring a text book.

All the best,
Juan
