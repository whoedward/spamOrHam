Happy Reading Week Norris Staff!

To help you all get through this rough time in the quarter, we'll be hosting a study break for all Norris student employees this Thursday, 3/14 in the Game Room from 4-6pm.There will be pizza, snacks, desserts, games, MASSAGE CHAIRS, and all your favorite student employees! Take a little time off from studying and come hang out with us. You deserve it.

Love and endless snacks,
Meredith
