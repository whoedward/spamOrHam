Hey ISRCers,

I hope your first week back went well. I am planning to have IFN on different days instead of one particular day each week. So please do fill out the doodle that I sent you guys by TUESDAY to decide which days and times will be most convenient for all of us.

Also, on Wednesday 7:30 PM in the ISRC main lounge, Prof. Frank Safford will give us a fireside about  "Colombia: Historical Context and Current Issues". As a historian, Prof. Safford has done an extensive research in economics and political history of Colombia and Latin America. So, don't forget to mark your calendar for this wonderful opportunity ! See you then !

Best,
Arkar
