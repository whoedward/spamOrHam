Hello everyone,

The KASA Show is this Friday at 8 PM. Our club is the very first act. If you are not in the demo but are coming to watch, it'd be really great if you could record the demo on a camera for everyone to watch later. Meanwhile, I'll try to see if I can get the KASA people to give us a few extra tickets for "guests" so that you can watch it for free.

Meanwhile, if you are in the KASA demo, we will be meeting in Blomquist at 7 sharp. Please, please, please do not be late. In fact, I recommend you come early because that would be fantastic.

And in case anyone of you forgot or didn't know, we're going to watch Iron Man 3 after the demo is over. We'll get on stage at 8, do the demo, store the mats in Plex for the night, and go to the 10 o clock showing.

Second order of business:

We're going to vote for next year's leadership during the first Monday practice after KASA Show. The positions are president, vice president, and treasurer. We need some fresh new faces in leadership to replace the old, aging, out of touch, and practically senile current leadership. I'll send more information about that later. Just keep it in mind for now. Practice is in 30 minutes, so I'm going to keep this short. See you all very soon!

Ji-hoon
