Hi Michael,

Obviously, I will be in town by then, but more specifically I should be around by about the fifth or so.

    Hello all,

    Hope your summer is treating you well.  I need a head count of folks who will be returning to campus before classes start.  We have Wildcat welcome and Norris at Night happening the week of September 15-20.  So if you will be back in town by the 15th and want some hours please let me know.

     

    Thanks,

     

    Michael
