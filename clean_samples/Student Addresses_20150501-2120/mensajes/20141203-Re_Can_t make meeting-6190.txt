This made me laugh very hard. Thank you, Schlehuber.

        Hello,

        I won’t be able to make the meeting because I’ll be in a concert tomorrow night.

        I only have one shift I won’t be able to make during finals week (continuing ed 11-3 on Thursday) so I’ll release it on shift planning.

        Thanks!
