    Hey supers,

    I already told you that I have practice during meeting times this quarter so I don't think I'll be able to attend, but I'm emailing you because I need my Friday 10-12pm shift covered and I was hoping you guys could take care of this during the meeting? I sort of really need it covered because I'm leaving town on Thursday for the weekend and can't attend to it even if no one steps up to take... I hope it doesn't come to that, but thanks guys!

    Best,
