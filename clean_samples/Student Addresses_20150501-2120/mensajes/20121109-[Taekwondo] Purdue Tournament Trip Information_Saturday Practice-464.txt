Hey everyone,

The purdue tournament is this Saturday, so there will be no Saturday practice.

For those of you who are going to compete, we are meeting in the Blomquist parking lot at 6 AM. Set your alarms accordingly and try not to party too hard tonight. Also, bring $20. Because that's how much registration costs for sparring, forms, and/or both. ;)

By the way, in case anyone is wondering who is going to compete:

Ji-hoon Kim
Daniel Sauza
Allan Dong
Pius Kim
Albert Hong

Everyone's doing sparring, and I'm doing both sparring and forms. Not sure who else is doing forms. Wish us all luck and see you all at practice Monday except the people listed above whom I'll see in the cold, dark parking lot at Blom.

Ji-hoon
