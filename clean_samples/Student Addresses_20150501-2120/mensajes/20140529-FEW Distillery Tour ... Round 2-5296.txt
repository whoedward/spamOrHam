Hey everyone,

We are trying one more time to make this tour happen before the quarter ends. If you are still interested in the tour, please fill out the following brief doodle poll to pick a day. Please do so by Sunday if you can / you're not too ... tired ... from Dillo Day. Remember, the tour will be in the afternoon on the chosen day.

Thanks!
