Hey Formal-Goers!

Thomas has informed me(Eric) that some of you are confused as to the dress code for Formal!

 From what I noticed last year, the dress is basically this: Don't go buy a prom dress/tux. I mean, if you want, but there's no real reason too. 

1.) Guys wear anything from a nice polo and slacks, to suit and tie. Not your "I'm a Doctor of Love" T-shirt from 10th grade and jeans.

2.) Girls wear dresses, which I am in no way an expert in categorizing, so I'll go with this description: Like going out dresses? Think cocktail party, not President's Dinner/jeggings. 

Any other questions, let us know!

Adios,
The Exec Board!
