Hey ISRCers!

Penny wars is starting NOW in the lobby! Come bring cash or change to donate to DM! Change counts as positive for your floor and cash is negative for other floors. We'll be in the lobby every evening until Monday through Thursday, so come donate! The winning floor will receive some kind of edible prize!

ISRClove,

Ellen
