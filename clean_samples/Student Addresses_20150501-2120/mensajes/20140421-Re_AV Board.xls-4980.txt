Do we still deliver the sound equipment and everything Wednesday and set it up? I'd rather not fight all that at 7:30 Thursday morning.

    So we had another Projector request at the Great room on Wednesday.  So instead of delivering the set up in the evening we will deliver it during the day at 3pm.  So I just need someone to go over at 4:30 to help the client and go back at 9pm to turn equipment off.  It will stay set up through Thursday morning and Thursday evening.  Then Thursday at 9:30 it gets Struck.
