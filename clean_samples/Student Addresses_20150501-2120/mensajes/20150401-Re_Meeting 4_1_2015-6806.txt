Hi guys,

I'm so sorry to say, but I had a required Tour Guide Kickoff meeting, which happens once a quarter, which was why I wasn't there. I was going to email the supervisor email, but all I can say is that it slipped my mind due to a hectic first week of spring. I'm really sorry for any inconvenience, but won't happen again. Please let me know if there's anything else I should do.

Thanks,
Magan
