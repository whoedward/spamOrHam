Hi, guys,

For those of you guys who tested this past spring quarter and still have not received your belts, Master Kallo should (fingers crossed) bring them in tomorrow. With that being said, if you are expecting your belt tomorrow, please come with your uniform to practice. Remember that practice starts at 8 P.M. as usual. Try to get there by 7:50 P.M. I will see you guys then.

Yours,
Davin
