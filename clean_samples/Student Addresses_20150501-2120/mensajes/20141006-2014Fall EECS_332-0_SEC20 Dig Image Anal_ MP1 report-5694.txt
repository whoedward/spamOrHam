Hi class,

     You will need to submit a report for assignment 1. In the report, you need to show final your labeling result. You may also show intermediate result and explain why is that.

     It is recommended to visualize your labeling result as an image. You can either assign each label a color, or unique intensity. Result visualization is an intuitive and important evaluation method, I believe you will benefit from that.
