Hey guys,

I just remembered a few more rules.

9) Papers will NEVER be hidden in areas people can not usually access. This includes, but is not limited to: bathrooms, dorm rooms, exec office, etc.). However, they might be hidden AROUND those areas...

10) This one is for the honor system. Please don't ask people outside of your teams for help in deciphering my clues. That's why you have a team to help.

11) My clues will be varied in how they articulated. Sometimes they will be riddles. Other times, I will write the riddle as if the paper is a person describing their location, etc.

    Hey everyone,

    Thanks for signing up for the scavenger quest! This e-mail will be the one I use to hand out clues, so keep this e-mail in your inbox! So here are the rules:

    1) The scavenger quest will start at 9:30pm November 3rd and end at 9:30pm November 10th.
    2) You will need to find small squares of white printer paper which I will hid around ISRC. I will ONLY hide these papers within the building, so the area outside of ISRC is off-limits.
    3) You will know if the paper is legitimate if it has 2 things on it: a random word on top and my signature on the bottom.
    4) Papers will ALWAYS be visible at some angle (note: I am very "loose" with my definition of visible. So be alert.).
    5) I will send out clues at pre-determined times. The 1st clue is vague and should lead you to the general area. The 2nd clue is more specific and should help you narrow your search. The 3rd clue is a blatant statement on where the paper is.
    6) There is no max amount of papers I will hide. It will all depend on how fast all of you find them.
    7) Once you find a paper, you must e-mail me where you found the clue AND the word that is written on the paper. This must be done NO LATER than 1 hour after you find the paper. If I find out that a team is holding on to a paper for longer than this time frame for "strategical advantage," that team will be penalized harshly.
    8) I will be walking around at several points watching your progress. You are allowed to ask me questions and clarifications regarding the clues I send out, but I will most likely be as vague as possible.

    That's all of the rules I can think of at the moment. So read up and get ready. The competition for a $50 Visa gift card is about to begin!

    Remember, the competition will begin at 9:30 tonight!

    Good luck,
    Thomas
