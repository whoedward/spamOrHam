Today is the last day to get your orders in/get money into me. I'm closing off orders at 5pm but you can give me money until midnight. 

>> To find me on Venmo, search "Becca Wu"

There are a good 10 or so of you who still have yet to pay me. If you don't have a Venmo account, here is where you can find me for the rest of the night:

2-3 I'll be at Norris chillin
3-5 I'll be at the TI Box Office (located in the Barber Theatre) << this is the best time to get money to me if you're on south campus
5-10 I should be at my apartment (1740 Hinman -- aka Hinman and Clark) << text me if you are in da neighborhood
10:30-11 I'll be at the prod meeting (another great time to give me $$$)
11-> I will most likely be at Garnett so text me to meet up

You have no excuses. Give me yo monay. If I don't have you marked off as paid by midnight, tonight, you are not getting a hat! (text/email me for extenuating circumstances)

peace love ghost hats,
bwu
