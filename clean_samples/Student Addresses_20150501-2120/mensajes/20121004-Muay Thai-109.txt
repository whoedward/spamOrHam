Hey everyone,

Muay Thai will be starting up this Sunday from 10am-12pm at SPAC, in basketball court #1 which is the court nearest to the entrance. Sean Bowen-Williams and I will be instructing.
Just so no one shows up in the wrong place, again, Muay Thai will be in SPAC. Please don't show up to Blomquist.

If anyone has any boxing gloves, hand wraps, or general pads, please bring them! Furthermore, I highly encourage people who know they will continue taking this class to buy their own gloves and hand wraps. Hand wraps are pretty cheap (~$7), gloves a little less so (~$30), but it means you won't have to share sweaty gear with other people.

Lastly, if you have hand wraps and don't remember how to wrap them, show up a bit early and we'll go over it with you.

Hope to see you guys there!
