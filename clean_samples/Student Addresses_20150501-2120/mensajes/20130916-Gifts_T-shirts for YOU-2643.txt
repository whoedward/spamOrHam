Hey everyone,

We like giving you stuff, so starting on Wednesday until Sunday, I will be in the main lounge from around 9:00am - 4:00pm ready to give you fabulous ISRC gifts and awesome t-shirts that you may have already seen around the dorm. I'm also going to take a picture of you for our ISRC picture roster.

Thomas
