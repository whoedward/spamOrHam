Hey all,

We're ordering Taekwondo warm-up suits! Here's your chance to sport some Northwestern Taekwondo apparel on campus.

They'll be the same as in the picture below, but with "Taekwondo" embroidered under the Northwestern "N" instead of "Triathlon."

Prices:
Men's/Women's Jacket w/ embroidery: $38
Men's/Women's Pants w/ embroidery: $35
You can choose to order the entire set or just one part.

Deadline to order is this upcoming Thursday, May 15th.
To order, fill out the form below:

I'll try to bring a sample suit to practice Monday.
Email me with any other questions.

Cheers,
Andrew
