Hi NTS,

I forgot to send out the AV Board in the meeting notes, so I'm sending it now.

Please make sure you are there on time for Ryan events. Our policy is that if you wait 2 hours past the time the event was supposed to start and they do not show up, you can leave the event.

We still need Ryan coverage for 1-6pm on Saturday, so please respond asap if you can take that shift.

Thanks,

Alex
