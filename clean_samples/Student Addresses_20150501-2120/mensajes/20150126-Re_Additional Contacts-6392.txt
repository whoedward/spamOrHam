Maurice,

You can keep trying to get in touch with Nathan, or you can use either of these two contacts:

Michael Wang
937-443-84550
2315 Sheridan Road Room 221

or

Paul Kim
334-750-9141
1861 Sheridan Road Room 330

Either one will do, and they're both acceptable to use as character contacts.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,
Ethan
