Hey Best Fairchildren,

On Tuesday night, there will be a special IFN sponsored by NU Interfaith Advocates. 
We are going to watch a beautiful non-narrative documentary called "Baraka"  that showcases various spiritual lives around the world. The movie will start at 8PM in the main lounge(The committee meeting will start at 7:45). There will be wings, drinks and a short discussion afterwards. So, come for the wings and stay for the enlightenment !  

See ya there,
Arkar
