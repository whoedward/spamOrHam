Nelson,

It's totally okay. Shiftplanning is... in the works. As of right now, we're having a lot of little bugs with stuff like this. So, no worries.

Best,
Ethan

I think Jolo had this same problem where he was signed up for this shift, I thought this happened to everyone so I didn't think I needed to notify you guys about it. Regardless, I did not sign up for this shift, and it was just placed on me. Sorry for not notifying the supervisors about this problem earlier.
