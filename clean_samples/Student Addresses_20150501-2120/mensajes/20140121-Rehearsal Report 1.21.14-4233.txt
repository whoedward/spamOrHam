Hey team, 

Hope your nights are going well! Just to emphasize, tomorrow we're hoping to do our water run, and on Thursday, we'll be doing another full run through of the show which you're all invited to!

I'll be getting in contact with some of you individually about what needs to happen today and tomorrow, but otherwise, let me know if this report brings up any questions for you!

Rehearsal Notes:

    Selina led us in a warm-up today, after which we worked through some of the scenes Maia had wanted to work after our run-through on Saturday, but which we didn’t have time for.
    After that, we did another run through of the show, but in the most over-the-top (yet still motivated) Shakespearean style possible. The actors went a lot farther with many of their choices, which was really fun to see! It was also incredibly productive; almost all of the new choices or details were things that Maia wanted to keep. It was fun to find some new stuff, since we’ve been running some of this show for almost a month now.
