Hello all,
You are receiving this e-mail because you signed up for Todoroki. This is a reminder that we are leaving ISRC at 11:45 AM, which is in less than 9 hours. We will leave promptly as our reservation is at noon, so please plan accordingly. If you have notified me that you will be meeting us at the restaurant, I have accounted for that.

Thank you very much. See y'all tomorrow.
Paul Kim
