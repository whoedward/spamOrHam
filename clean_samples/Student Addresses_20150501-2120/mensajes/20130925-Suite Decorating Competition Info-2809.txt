Hey everyone,

By Wednesday of next week, please pick a country your suite will represent. Your country must currently exist in the real world, not claimed by another suite, and a country that you know you can provide food for munchies. E-mail Nathan and me of your decision. I will soon send out a spreadsheet so you can see which countries have been picked already. China and Russia have been claimed.

Thanks, and more info for this to come!
Thomas
