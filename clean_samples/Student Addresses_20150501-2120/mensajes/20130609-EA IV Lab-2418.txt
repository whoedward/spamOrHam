Hello Nir,

I am Ethan Robison, a student in Dr. Kath's EA IV class. I wanted to ask you if you are still holding office hours tomorrow (Monday, 6/10/13) from 2-4 p.m. If you are, I can ask my questions then.

However, if you are not, then I would like to ask you about part 2 of the lab.
Although Dr. Kath's notes have examples for solving a system with damping (but no forcing) and a system with forcing (but no damping), there is nothing that outlines doing a system with both.
When we did systems with single equations (i.e., without matrices), one could use undetermined coefficients to solve this type of system. However, using undetermined coefficients does not seem to help much here.
Could you help me to get started on the solution, perhaps?

Of course, if you are having office hours, I can just come to those.

If there is anything that I can do to make things more clear, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
