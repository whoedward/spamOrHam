Hi Rafael,

Unfortunately, this quarter has been even more hectic than the last, in a way. I have an event this Friday that I have to run and cannot attend class.

Best,
Ethan

    Hi all,

    Will any of you be at class on Friday? Caroline and I have to go to an
    award dinner with her parents and will not be able to make practice.
    If none of you can make it, i will let sensei know and cancel class.
    The last couple of Friday's it has just been me and sensei.

    Rafael
