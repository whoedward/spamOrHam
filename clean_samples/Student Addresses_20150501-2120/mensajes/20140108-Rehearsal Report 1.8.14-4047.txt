Rehearsal Notes:

    We were able to run through Act I for the first time off book, and it went very well in general! There were only a few problem spots with lines, but everyone seems ready to get back into the swing of things very nicely.
    Luckily Maia and I had built a bit of a buffer into the rehearsal time, so we most likely won’t need to add any extra rehearsals to make up for the past two snow days! We are a little bit behind where we originally planned to be, but we’ll catch up during our extra time in the week prior to tech week.
