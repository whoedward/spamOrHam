Hi NTS,

This is the revised schedule for Spring quarter, there's a bunch of changes from the last one, so make sure you know what shifts you're assigned to.

This schedule goes into effect tomorrow.

If there are any conflicts/complaints, email me and I'll try to get them sorted out, otherwise, we'll go over the schedule at the first meeting.

In addition, we need one tech to be at Norris from 5 to 8pm at minimum, though there are hours available from now until midnight. We absolutely need this event covered, so please respond to Michael's email if you can take the event.

Thanks,

Alex
