Hi Supervisors,

I'm sorry to say, but I won't be able to make the meeting tomorrow. I have to go to the ASG Senate meeting, since I'm on this funding committee within ASG and we're releasing recommended funds to a bunch of student groups. I don't have any shifts to get covered though. Please let me know if you guys need anything else.

Thanks!
Magan
