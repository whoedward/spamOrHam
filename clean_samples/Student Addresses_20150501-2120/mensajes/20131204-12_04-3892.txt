Hey, guys,

I hope all of you guys are enjoying your reading week, for those who have it. For those who don't, feel free to share your sufferings with me :) Anyway, there will be normal practice today, but we will NOT be taking part in contact sparring. We don't want anyone who is testing to get injured right before the test.

Also, for those of you who are testing this Sunday, please come to Patten Gymnasium no later than 10:15 A.M. You guys are more than welcome to start warming-up as soon as you guys get there. Make sure to bring your clean, white uniforms to the test. Also, when any of the masters call you up, please answer with a loud and clear "yes, sir!" and make sure to move quickly. You guys will all do just fine :)

Due to some schedule conflicts with some people, I'm planning on moving this last general meeting to 1 P.M. this Saturday at the Plex lobby (right across the street from Blomquist). Depending on how many people show up to practice, we may either end practice early or keep the floor open to the color belts who want to keep practicing. I will check back with everyone at Blomquist around 2 P.M. and help clean up in the latter case. Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

That is it for now, I believe. Thank you all for everything this quarter. I really appreciate all your enthusiasm and help. Let either me or Natalie know if there is anything else you would like to see in our club and we will try our best to make things happen :) Best of luck with the end of Fall 2013.

Yours,
Davin
