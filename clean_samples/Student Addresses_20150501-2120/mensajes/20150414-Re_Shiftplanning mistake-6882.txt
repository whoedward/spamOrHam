Hey,

Yes, that was our bad for missing the update on shiftplanning.  We will fix it, don't worry.  Thanks for letting us know!

    Hello,

    I took Phoebe’s 6-8 shift today but it’s still her’s on shift planning. 

    Do I have to fix that on my end or is that something you can do?

    Thanks.
