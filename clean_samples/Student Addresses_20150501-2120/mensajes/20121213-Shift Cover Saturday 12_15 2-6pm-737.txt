Hey everybody! I know that everyone is finishing up their finals for the rest of the week but I was wondering since I am currently home, if anyone can cover my saturday afternoon shift from 2-6 pm. I would love you forever and make/buy you food when I am back for doing me a favor. 
Thanks!
Brett Warner
