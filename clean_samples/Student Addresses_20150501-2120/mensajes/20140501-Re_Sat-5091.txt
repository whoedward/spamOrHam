I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope that all turns out well.
I will, in that case, see you on Tuesday.

Best,
Ethan

    Sorry (again) but I'm going to have to cancel this Sat; I tweaked my back and have to visit the chiropractor. I still have plenty to work on between now and next Tuesday, (including a huge art project for Monday  and my next blog post!)
    Have a great weekend,
    Barbara
