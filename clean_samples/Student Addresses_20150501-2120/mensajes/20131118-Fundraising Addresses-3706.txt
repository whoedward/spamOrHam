Hi lovely prod team!

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Carly, and I am the fundraising director for Julius Caesar. One of the biggest fundraisers we have planned for the show is sending letters and emails to the family and friends of the team asking for support to make Julius Caesar a reality. As such, the fundraising team is asking all of you to supply us with two addresses and two email addresses of family and friends who you think would be willing to contribute to the show. Of course, if you have more contacts who are interested in supporting our work, feel free to add more addresses/email addresses, however only two of each are mandatory. 

Here is the form that needs to be filled out by the time of the prod meeting this Sunday: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1uwAOViA7Crmv_g-GFG7VZLRExC0jd0_iKL6dfseuCqU/viewform. 

If you fill it out in time, this will be me: http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Elf.gif.

Appreciate you all!

Carly
