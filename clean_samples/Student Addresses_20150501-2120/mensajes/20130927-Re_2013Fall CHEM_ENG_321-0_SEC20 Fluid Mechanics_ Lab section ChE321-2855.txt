1:15 is fine.  Just thought I would try for the 11:15, since there were less students.

See you then,

Erica

    Unfortunately, I have a class at that time. I am available from noon until two, and from three o' clock onwards. I spoke with Eric Niemeyer, who also has the 1:15 p.m. slot, and he suggested that I join him for that session. Would that be acceptable?

        Hi Ethan, you can make up the lab next week.  I no longer have your schedule on hand, but would it be possible for you to come at 11:15, since there are only 3 people in that section?  If not, we can accommodate you into another time, just please let me know.

        Thanks,

        Erica

            Hi Erica,

            I absolutely forgot. I apologize for the oversight on my part, but I was under some sort of impression that I had a lab scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon as opposed to 1:15 p.m. Is there any way in which I can make up the lab next week when the second group runs its trials?

            Best,

                Hi Ethan,

                Are you still enrolled in Chem Eng 321?  You were scheduled for lab at 1:15 this afternoon, and you have not yet shown up, so I wanted to check to see if you maybe just forgot.

                Thanks,

                Erica McCready
