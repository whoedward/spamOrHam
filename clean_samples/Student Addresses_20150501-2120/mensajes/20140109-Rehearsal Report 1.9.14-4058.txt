Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a productive day of blocking, and were able to get through the first two scenes of Act II, and a large chunk of the third scene.
    We’re exactly where we need to be in terms of time/scheduling! Hoping things stay on track, but it’s looking good.

Scenery Notes:

    None today.

Prop Notes:

    We’d like Antony and Octavius to have alcohol for scene 4.1.

Costume Notes:

    Taylor needs a place to sheathe a dagger during scene 4.3. Not sure if this was already accounted for (it may be), but a thing to note.

Light Notes:

    None today.

Sound Notes:

    None today.

Miscellaneous Notes:

    See you at 10:30!
