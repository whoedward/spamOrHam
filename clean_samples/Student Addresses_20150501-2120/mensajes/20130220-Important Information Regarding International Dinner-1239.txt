Special Instructions

When you’re done cooking your dish:
IF IT’S SATURDAY: put your dish in the aluminum tins we provide and cover with foil.  Try to find space in a fridge but if you can’t, find an exec member and we can help.  Tell the exec member where you stored it. Label it with your name and dish title. 

     If IT’S SUNDAY: bring your dish back to the exec library and give it to the exec member in charge.  We will bring it to the alumni center for you.


 If you want us to reheat your dish, let an exec member know by Sunday.
