Hi everyone!

We've rescheduled the RCB Hunger Games for this Saturday, (today!!) November 16th at 7PM in Tech!! Make sure to come out and support our ISRC tributes! Also, we've had someone have to drop out, so if you would like to volunteer as tribute in her stead, please let me know. Thanks! May the odds be ever in your favor!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
