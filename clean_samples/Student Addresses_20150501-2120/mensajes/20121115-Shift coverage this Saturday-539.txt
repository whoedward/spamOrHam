Hey guys,

Could anyone cover my 8am-2pm shift this Saturday?  One of my classes
has a field trip that's really important to go on.  I can take osme of
your shifts if you want me to.  This shift is cake city.

Also, can anyone cover my 10am-12pm on Sunday the 25th?  I won't be
back in town yet.

Thanks,

Will
