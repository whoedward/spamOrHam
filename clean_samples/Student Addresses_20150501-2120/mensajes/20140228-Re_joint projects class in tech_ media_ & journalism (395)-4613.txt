Dear Prof. Larry,

I am a sophomore majoring in CS and am interested in your EECS 395 class. I'm currently in the wait list and it would be great if you could give me a permission number.

Also, I was wondering if this class counts as a project requirement for CS majors and what kind of projects students do. Do you have a link online where I could look at past projects and how technical are they?

Thank you!

Best,
Divir
