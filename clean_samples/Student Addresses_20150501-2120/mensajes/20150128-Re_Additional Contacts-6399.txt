    Maurice,

    You can keep trying to get in touch with Nathan, or you can use either of these two contacts:

    Michael Wang
    937-443-84550
    2315 Sheridan Road Room 221

    or

    Paul Kim
    334-750-9141
    1861 Sheridan Road Room 330

    Either one will do, and they're both acceptable to use as character contacts.

    Let me know if you need anything else.

    Regards,
    Ethan

        I caught up with everyone except for Nathan Lamp.  I've left two messages for him.
