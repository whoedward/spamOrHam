Hi Joy,

I'm one of the students in your Friday discussion section, and I just had a quick question about bringing the documents to class: would it be alright if I brought the documents in on my e-reader, that way I don't have to print them out?
Printing is a little expensive, and my allotment as an engineering student only covers about 120 pages worth throughout the quarter.

I understand if your policy doesn't allow this, I just figured that I should ask.

Please let me know if you need any more information from me.

Best,

--
