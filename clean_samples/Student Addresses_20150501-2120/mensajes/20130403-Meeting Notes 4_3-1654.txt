Hi NTS,

Here are the meeting notes from tonight

Announcements

Please make sure you are passing on information about which events need to be set up/cleared at the end of your shift. We have had a bit of trouble with equipment being left out/projectors being kept on even though the techs on the previous shift indicated that all the events were cleaned up.

If you want to apply for a Norris leadership position for next year, the email has been sent out/forwarded to each of you; if you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out to any of us.

Shift Coverages

Phoebe Sun 6-8pm ----> Juan
Phoebe Sun 8-10pm ------> Matt

If you have any shift conflicts remaining, please send them out over the listserv.
