Ok everyone so first off
Great great season. I'm so proud of everybody that played and
HUGE SHOUTOUT to all of you that showed up today it was CLUTCH. So many people scored today and played D and everything and it was probably the best team effort I've seen all season. Thank you so much to everybody that came out this quarter- we made the playoffs, and that's really something.

Thank you so much for a great season - it was awesome getting to know all of you better through IM, which like independent of our record or whatever was a really awesome opportunity.

That being said, our HOCKEY season is not yet over!
First playoff game is Monday, March 3rd. Get hyped.

ISRC love
Paul Kim
