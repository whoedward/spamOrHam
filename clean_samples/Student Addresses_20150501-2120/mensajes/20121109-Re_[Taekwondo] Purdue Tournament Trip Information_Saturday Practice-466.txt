Also VERY IMPORTANT.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHEST PROTECTOR, let us know now!  Jihoon will need to grab a few from the blom lockers before it closes today.  Or someone else with the locker combination.

I for one, don't have one...  #3 please?  =D

    Hey everyone,

    The purdue tournament is this Saturday, so there will be no Saturday practice.

    For those of you who are going to compete, we are meeting in the Blomquist parking lot at 6 AM. Set your alarms accordingly and try not to party too hard tonight. Also, bring $20. Because that's how much registration costs for sparring, forms, and/or both. ;)

    By the way, in case anyone is wondering who is going to compete:

    Ji-hoon Kim
    Daniel Sauza
    Allan Dong
    Pius Kim
    Albert Hong

    Everyone's doing sparring, and I'm doing both sparring and forms. Not sure who else is doing forms. Wish us all luck and see you all at practice Monday except the people listed above whom I'll see in the cold, dark parking lot at Blom.

    Ji-hoon
