Hey all!

I hope everyone's enjoying their breaks. We're really excited about spring quarter this year. A lot of our big events (E-Week, Senior Sendoff and Dinner with 12 Strangers) will all be happening this quarter. Brennan and I will be updating this email thread with further information regarding MSAB plans for once break's over but for now, PLEASE fill out this whenisgood to determine our meeting time. 


Thank you,
