The Associate Director of University Housing, Mark D'Arienzo, will be coming to ISRC TODAY to explain the points/housing system here at Northwestern and answer any and all questions you may have about your living situation next year, whether or not you decide to stay in ISRC or in the RC system.


So, come to the Main Lounge at 8 p.m. to get any concerns taken care of, and hey - you'll even get an Academic point for doing so.
