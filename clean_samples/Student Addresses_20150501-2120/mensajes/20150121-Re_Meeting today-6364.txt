Hello,

I am sorry but I cannot make it to the meeting this week because I would like to attend an info session that is held at the same time. I will try to make it to the later half of the meeting if it ends early. I don't have any shifts to give up and feel free to text me at 630-885-6698 if you guys need me to take anything.

Thanks

Sandy Cheung
