Hi All!

Your fellows chair here to tell you that the last fellows social will be happening in the ISRC dining area of Hinman at 12PM noon on Friday Devember 6th! Come and get lunch with the awesome fellows of the dorm, and afterwards, stop by the main lounge for a delicious spread of middle eastern desserts! 

For those who are missing points, attendance at the event grants you a social point while assistance with set up or clean up grants you a service point. Furthermore, I will be holding a baklava making session the night before. Look out for another announcement for the opportunity to help out and get another service point.

Hope you all had amazing Thanksgivings!

Cheers,
Chang Tang
