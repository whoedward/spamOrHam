Hi NTS,

Here are the notes from tonight's meeting

Announcements:

We are giving out awards this year, and we need you guys to vote on who you think is the Tech of the year and who is the most improved tech.

Here's the link to the Google form, please try to get it back to us ASAP, it'll literally take 20 seconds.
