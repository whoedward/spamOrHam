Hello everyone,

I will be running this sunday's practice again, usual place, usual time 11:00 at blom.  This week we will review some of the techniques we did last week and do lots of drilling to get more of a live feel for the moves you are learning.  We will also be covering some sidemount positioning tips and submissions as well as touch up our ability to hold people down in mount.  Hope to see you there!
