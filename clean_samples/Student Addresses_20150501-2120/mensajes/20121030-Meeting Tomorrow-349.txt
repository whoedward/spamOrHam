Hi NTS,

We're having our meeting tomorrow from 7-8pm, in the Louis Room. If you cannot make the meeting, send your reason to ntssupervisors@gmail.com by midnight tonight.

Also, we're looking for extra techs to work tomorrow from 8am-12pm, so if you want to work, please email Michael.

Thanks,

Alex
