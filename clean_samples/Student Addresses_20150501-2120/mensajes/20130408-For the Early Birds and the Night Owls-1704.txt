Hello Fellow Techs,

Hope you're all getting your Spring Quarter legs about you; I know I still am, so I won't harp about it.

We have an early open and late close this week, woot!  Cross your fingers and drumroll please...

--Wednesday (4/10):  7 am, be there!
--Friday (4/12):  1:30 am, hang in there!

Well, that's all for now--I've gone and exhausted my enthusiasm quotient for the day again.

Thanks for all the hard work,

Marina
