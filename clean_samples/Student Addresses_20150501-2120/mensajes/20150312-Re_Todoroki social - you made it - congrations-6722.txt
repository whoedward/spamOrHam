    Hi all,
    Thanks for signing up for our Todoroki lunch. This email is to confirm your spot for our social, and to restate that it will be on Friday, March 13th, at noon. I know in the email I sent out last night it said 11:30, but that was because I wrote it earlier and forgot to change it. So, again, our reservation is at noon, not 11:30.

    That being said. Please meet in the main lounge by 11:45 Friday the 13th (spooky) so we can get to Todoroki in time for our reservation.

    If you cannot make it anymore for whatever reason, please let me know. If anything comes up and you need to reach me in an emergency, my phone number is 334-750-9141.
    I'll be sending out another e-mail as we get closer to the date to remind you all.

    Best,
    Paul
