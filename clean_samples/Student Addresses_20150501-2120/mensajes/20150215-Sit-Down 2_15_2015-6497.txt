Hi Ahren,

This is just a follow-up to our discussion today. I wanted to remind you that the other Supers and I (as well as Chris) can be relied upon to help you out if you need it.

That said, be sure to make department meetings whenever possible, and let us know when you can't.

This email is also a record of your first warning. No disciplinary action will be taken, but keep that in mind.

If you have any questions, please let me, another super, or Chris know.

Regards,
Ethan
