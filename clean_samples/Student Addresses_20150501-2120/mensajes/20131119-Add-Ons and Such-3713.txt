Hi All,

This is a friendly reminder about add-ons. When an event comes up that is not on the sheets, put its location, equipment, and end time somewhere on thr sheets so that techs later in the day know what is going on in the building. Make sure to let the person on the next shift know about any add-ons, as well.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me or ntssupervisors@gmail.com.

Best,
Ethan
