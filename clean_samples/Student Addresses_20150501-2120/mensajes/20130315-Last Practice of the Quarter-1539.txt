Hi everyone,

I was thinking of canceling practice tomorrow, because I have a lot of work to do, but I don't want to cancel the last practice of the quarter. So, we will be having a short practice tomorrow from 2-3 at Blomquist. We'll mostly just roll and go over anything people want to work on. It should be a nice stress reliever.

Hope to see people there,
Jacob
