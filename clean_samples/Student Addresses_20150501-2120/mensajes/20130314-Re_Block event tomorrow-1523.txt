    I really need to do well on this final so I really need to be able to go to this review session. If anyone can take the last hour of this event I would be so grateful.

        Hey guys, I found out the review session for my exam starts at 6 instead of 7. Would someone be able to come at like 5:50 so I could go to the review? I really need to do well on this exam and I would appreciate the help so much.
