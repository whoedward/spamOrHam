Dear ISRC,

As we prepare for International Dinner, the Exec needs all of the space in the refrigerators to store all the goodies we are buying. We are asking everyone to remove any personal items from the kitchens by the end of the day on Friday, Feb 13th. Anything left WILL be thrown out. 

If you have any questions please let me or another exec member know. 

Thank you for all your help!

Best,
Esteban
