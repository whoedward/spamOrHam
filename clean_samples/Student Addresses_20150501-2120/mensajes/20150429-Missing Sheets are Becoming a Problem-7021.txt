Today I was in the building here from 8 to the close, and between the 5 of you who were on shift, the last set of sheets were lost in this time interval and continued to be lost, and nobody bothered to check for them until the sweep, resulting in a good amount of confusion.

Nobody is in trouble. However, I found the sheets in the Northwestern room right by the stack. I would ask that those of you receiving this take special care not to lose the sheets, and furthermore, if you have lost them and cannot find them, then your best bet is to call the CM and look off their sheets, or just try really hard to find them.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me back an email.

From,
Michael
