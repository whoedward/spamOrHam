Hello Everyone!!

Well, get excited for TOMORROW at 7:50!!
Just a couple of reminders:

    Take note of the time change. We are starting the practice at 8, so please come at 7:50 to help set up the mats.

    Please sign the waiver and consent form at www.nuim.net/clubsports/index.php before coming to practice. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on 'Waiver and Consent Form'. It should only take a couple of minutes to complete it.

    Come in uniforms if you own them. Otherwise, wear comfortable clothes; we will be kicking!

    If you haven't been to a gym yet, bring your Wildcard. You need to scan your wildcard to enter the gym.


As always, if you have any questions, feel free to email me or Davin (davinkim2015@u.northwestern.edu).

Hope to see you all tomorrow at 7:50 at Blom!

Thanks,
Natalie Kim
