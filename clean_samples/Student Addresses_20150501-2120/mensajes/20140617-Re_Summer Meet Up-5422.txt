Hey Guys,

I would completely be down for a meet up at some point this summer, and I would be fine for basically any weekend from now up to the beginning of August. I'm not sure if I can necessarily make it out of Chicago (the French consulate has me on a short leash because I don't know when my visa appointment is / if I need any more) but if it is decided that the meetup is somewhere else, I'll do my best! Although, if Chicago does turn out to be a non-option, I guess there is always the now extinct Jewish population and staggering 25 flowerbeds in Ligonier! http://www.ligonier-in.org/visiting_thingstodo.html

In any case, I hope everybody is having a good beginning to their summer!

Cheers,
Chang
