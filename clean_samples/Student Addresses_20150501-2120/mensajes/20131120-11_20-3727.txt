Hey, guys,

Just a reminder that there is practice today at 8 P.M. at Blomquist and that you should bring your sparring gear, if you have one. I also just want to encourage you guys once again to really consider investing in a full sparring gear if you are planning on sticking with Tae Kwon Do. It might be a little costly, but if it's something you're planning on doing for a while, then it could be a worthwhile and rewarding investment.

Also, there will be no practice this Saturday because there is a football game that day and Blomquist will be closed as a result. Go out and support the Cats, and let's hope we can salvage something from this season.

See y'all soon~

Yours,
Davin
