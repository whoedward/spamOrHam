Rehearsal Notes:

    We’ve officially blocked through Act I of the show! This puts us in a very good place for reading week; we’ll be able to go back through Act I and run stuff that needs reviewing, so that it can get in the actors’ heads better.
    We won’t be having rehearsal tomorrow, because several people won’t be able to come, and there wouldn’t be much of a point.
    We also should have all the footage we need for our initial Indiegogo vid! Jackson, if you need to come in any more days or have any more questions, please let me or Matt know.
    Have an awesome Thanksgiving, everyone! J

Scenery Notes:

    There needs to be a way for people to get to the pulpit easily from onstage (not backstage)

Prop Notes:

    Would it be possible to get a “fake John MacGaffey” for scenes after his death (i.e. for when Antony et. al carry the body onstage)?
    Pros/cons of coffin vs. fake body wrapped in sheet?

Costume Notes:

    None today!

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    Will Brutus be mic’d with reverb during scene 3.2?
    We will need to then figure out how to get that mic onstage

Miscellaneous Notes:

    None today!
