Hello, lovely ISRCers!

This is an email to remind you all to SIGN UP FOR THE RCB FORMAL! I'm going to borrow Jonas's description of the formal from a previous email: 

The RCB Formal will be the evening of Saturday, October 26. This will be a dance at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (transportation provided). There will appetizers and some floors of the museum will be open. It will be a lot of fun and your friends from other RCs will be there as well. Tickets are $20. You can sign up on the sign-up sheets posted around ISRC, or email me, Nathan, etc.

More importantly, pay $20 to Nathan ASAP or your ticket will not be reserved! If you've signed up already but haven't paid, just put $20 in an envelope with your name on it and slip it under Nathan's door on the 3rd floor. IT WILL BE SO MUCH FUN!!!! BE THERE!!!!

Thanks, guys. :)

ISRClove,
Ayla
