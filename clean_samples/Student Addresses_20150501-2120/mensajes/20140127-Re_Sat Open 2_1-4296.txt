        Hello friends,
         
        I am leaving for Atlanta on Saturday at around 4AM and will not be here for the shift. I know it is early but I would really appreciate it if someone could cover this shift for me.
         
        I have also released this shift on shiftplanning
         
        Thanks!
        Max
