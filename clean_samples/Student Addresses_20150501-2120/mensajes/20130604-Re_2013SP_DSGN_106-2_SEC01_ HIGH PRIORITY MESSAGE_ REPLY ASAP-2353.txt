Hello Dean Holtgreive,

This slot should work for me, unless there turns out to be a final for my tutorial class (there is not supposed to be one).

Best,
Ethan Robison

    Folks,

    Our scheduled final presentation time next Wednesday morning conflicts with the Common Final for CHEM 103. In an effort to find another time that works for everyone I am suggesting Tuesday evening from 7pm to 9pm location TBD. I need to as soon as possible if this time would work for everyone. The scheduled final during that time slot is MWF 8am and a common final for Classics 110.

    Please confirm and reply immediately so we can locate a room and notify the clients of the change.

    Thanks,

    JJH
