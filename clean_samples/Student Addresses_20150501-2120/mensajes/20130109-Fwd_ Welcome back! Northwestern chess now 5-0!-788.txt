Hope everybody had relaxing and exciting breaks.

We'll be meeting the same time this quarter starting this Thursday 7-8:30pm in Kresge 1-330.  A couple Wednesday meetings on north campus may happen too so watch the emails.


Some other good news: Northwestern beat DRW Trading last night in a 4-2 victory to extend our record to 5-0!!!  Playoffs are in sight :)
