Hello Professors,

In regards to dividing up the funds, I would consider an equal pecuniary awards to be best allotted evenly; the members of my group (myself included): Mitchell Zubieta, Evan McConnel, Jonas Carlsson, and Patrick Peng, all did an extraordinary job fixing the mess that the five of us created.
So, with that said, we all eagerly await a $200 check.

Have an excellent summer.
Best,
Ethan Robison

    Hello there, Gang,
    I hope you are all basking in the success of your projects and presentations. Just seeing the look on Brian's father's face should assure you that you have chosen a profession that can make a profound difference in the people's lives.

    Now, there's just one more thing we'd like you to do. Imagine (yes, this is not for real), your team has been awarded a $1000 bonus for your final project--the design and its proof of concept mock up or prototype, the final proposal, and the presentation. How would you divide up the money? Would it be equally divided among all the team members, or do some team members deserve more than others? If the latter, how would you allot the money? Please send us an email with the names of your team members and how you would divide the money, along with a brief explanation of why you would divide it as you suggest.

    We are computing the final grades Friday morning, so we need your feedback no later than 9 a.m. on Friday, June 14th.

    After that, go home, sleep, have a heap of fun, and remember to stop by and say "hi." We were delighted to be your professors.

    All the best,

    Professors Herrick and Holtgreive
