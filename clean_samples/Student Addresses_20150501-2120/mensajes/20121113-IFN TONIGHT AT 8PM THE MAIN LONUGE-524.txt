Hey guys,

For IFN today, we are going to watch an Argentine crime thriller called The Secret in Their Eyes (El Secreto de Sus Ojos). It is a record breaking film in Argentine box office history, and it has also won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Film in 2010. Also, don't forget to come Academic and Fellow Committee meeting at  8PM ! See you all there !


Best,
Arkar
