Hello Techs,

Is everyone hanging in there for midterms?  I pray all goes well.

I apologize for this shift request being so late; I can by all means do it, but my mother's birthday is tomorrow so I was debating whether it might be a good idea to get an earlier start home.

Anyway, this shift's up for grabs.  Please don't feel obligated if you already have other Friday engagements.

Thanks for all the hard work,

Marina
