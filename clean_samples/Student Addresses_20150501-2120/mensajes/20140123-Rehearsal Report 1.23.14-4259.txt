Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a very productive, if a little chaotic, day. We started with a warm-up and fight call, then went straight into a run, which lasted for roughly the next two hours. There were very few holds, and no one called line, which was great!
    Starting around 8:30, Josh took us outside to record some chanting for background elements, which was exciting. Afterward, we were able to split up so that individual members of the cast would record with Josh for elements of the promo video, while simultaneously other actors were able to work with Jessica, Elise and Natalie to figure out their costumes.
    While we were eventually spread out into three different rooms in Kresge, we were efficient for the most part and got everything done that we needed to. Costumes knows what needs to be procured between now and the shows, and sound recorded what it needed to!
