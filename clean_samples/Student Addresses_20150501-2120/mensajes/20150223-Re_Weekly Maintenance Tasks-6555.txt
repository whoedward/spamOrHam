Hello!

This looks very organized and helpful!  I don't think it'll be a problem to implement, but we'll review it more in detail at our Supers' meeting on Wednesday and get back to you for sure.

Thanks,
Christina

    Hello Supervisors,

    In the past, Michael has given you a list of projects to be completed weekly.  The problem with the current system is that there is no accountability because nobody is in charge of any particular task.  So to remedy this, I’ve created a schedule. 

     

    Every task should be 10 minutes or less.  Tasks were assigned to shifts at random.  Traditionally busy shifts and Rotations are blacked out.  In theory, with 2 people on each shift, they could choose to do the task together, or trade off.  Or one person could do the task while the other helps a client.

     

    Please review, and let me know your thoughts.
