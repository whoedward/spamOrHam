Hi everyone,

Our meeting tomorrow will be in the Wildcat Room from 7-8pm. This will be your best opportunity to adjust your schedule for the coming quarter, so please try to make the meeting. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason as well as any shifts you wish to trade/release.
