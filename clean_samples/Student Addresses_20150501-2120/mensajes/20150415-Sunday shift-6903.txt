Hey guys,

I just checked shift planning and I don't think Chen's Sunday 4-8 PM shifts were given to me yet.. BUT I totally forgot to give that away for this week... I can't do Sunday 4-8 PM this week. Well, I could probably do 6-8 PM but.... 4-6 PM for sure I can't.. 
What should I do? Send an e-mail out to NTS? I don't have those shifts to release on shift planning.

Thanks,
Phoebe
