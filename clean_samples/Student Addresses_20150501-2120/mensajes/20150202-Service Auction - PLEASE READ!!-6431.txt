Hi ISRC! 

This month we will be holding our annual service auction! Residents will auction off goods and services, and anyone will be able to bid on them through the Facebook page. This will be our final fundraiser for DM! 
If you would like to volunteer a service, email me by next Tuesday (the 10th) at 11:59 pm! The auction will run February 11-22! 
Examples of services auctioned in the past are music lessons, picking up food, letting someone else give them a makeover, doing laundry, homemade dinner/baked goods, personal training, or paper editing. Be creative with your ideas! 
Good luck with midterms!

ISRClove,

Ellen
