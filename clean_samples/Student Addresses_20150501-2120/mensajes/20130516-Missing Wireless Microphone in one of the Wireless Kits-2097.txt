Hey all,

I found the wireless microphone set up in northwestern room. First of all, it was not indicated on the sheets that there was a wireless kit in that room. Please write such details down. More importantly, I looked around the room and the microphone that should be with the kit was missing. If you have any knowledge of what happened, please reply to this email.

Best,
Andrew Jung
