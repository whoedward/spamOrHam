Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I know you all will get an email from Rohan soon with the week's ISRC events, but as always, Book Buddies is very time-sensitive, so it merits a separate email. :) Email Diamanta Panford (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) ASAP if you want to do it, and CC me. 

ISRC-love,
Ayla

 Join us at the Evanston Public Library children's area at 3:30pm to read to kids for an afternoon! You'll receive a brief orientation about reading strategies with young children.
