    I can start us off. We'll be doing a Nuzlocke challenge, so here are the rules if you are unfamiliar:

    After I clear the first gym, I'll pass it off to... one of you? Whoever wants it, I guess. Basically, there are no rules (Schlehuber can fuck it up and probably will) except for Nuzlocke, so do whatever you want!

    If you have any questions, let me know. I'll get started today.

    Cheers,
