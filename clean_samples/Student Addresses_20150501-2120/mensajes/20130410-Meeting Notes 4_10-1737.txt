Sup NTS,

Here are the meeting notes from tonight's meeting.

Announcements -

Make sure you remember to show up for shifts - if you cannot make a shift, finding a replacement is your responsibility, whether its through the listserv or by calling people one by one. You have to find a replacement, otherwise the shift is still your responsibility and you have to show up for it.

If you miss a shift, there will be first a warning, the next missed shift is a formal write-up, then possible termination.

If you are on a closing shift, make sure you are sweeping all the rooms and checking to see if equipment has been left out/projectors are still on. We have had some problems with the morning shift coming in and finding things left out or projects being left on overnight. If this continues, we will need to implement a checklist where you certify that you have checked every room, making you personally responsible for anything that is left out overnight.

Shift Coverages

Ethan Sat 8am-10am -------> Cynthia
Angela Sun 10am-12pm ------> Taha
John Tues 8pm-12am ------>Tim W.
