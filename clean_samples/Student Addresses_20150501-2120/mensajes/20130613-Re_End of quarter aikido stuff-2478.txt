Hey Guys,

I'm back in Hagerstown right now, so I cannot make any meetings that you guys might have. However, I am on board with any decisions that you might make, so just let me know what it is that I need to do.

Best,
Ethan

    Hey guys,

    I think we are pretty much wrapped up with paperwork(thank you Alex), but there were three finance related tasks that still need to be done.

    1. Deposit dues- There is a check from Caroline and I for the quarter attached to the locker door.

    2.  We need a club check for Shinjinkai for $90 to cover half of Alex, Ted and Caroline's mat fees from last winter. I also need Alex's individual portion to bundle with the individual contributions for Ted, Caroline, and Myself.

    3. Lastly, we need to transfer the presidency to Ethan, so that the position will be held by a current student in the fall. It is a real pain to unlock the SOFO account if the president is not a current student.

    Cheers,

    Rafael
