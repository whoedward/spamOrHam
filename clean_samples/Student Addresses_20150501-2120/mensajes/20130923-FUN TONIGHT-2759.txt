Hi 3rd Floor!
If you guys didn't get the Facebook post, here is the message Maytal (2nd floor CA) posted:

Hey gang! I'm going to Comedy Night tonight and you guys should walk over with me! It should be really cool and funny (if you haven't experienced NU comedy groups, you're missing out). It starts at 8:30 at Harris Hall (literally right next door to us), but I'm thinking we should get there early cause it's FREE which means everyone's gonna try to get in. Meet me downstairs circa 8 pm so we can get seats!

So, if you want something fun tonigiht, MEET AT 8 ON THE 1ST FLOOR!

Thanks,
Matt Du
