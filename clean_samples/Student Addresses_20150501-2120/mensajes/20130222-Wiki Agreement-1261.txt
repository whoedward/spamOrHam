Since obviously we weren't able to meet in person to all sign the form, I circled NO and submitted the form since that was the only option for which I could fill out the form myself.

I don't think it matters either way, but if you take issue with my actions I will be willing to discuss them with you.

Stay sharp and enjoy your weekend; the agenda should be coming tomorrow,
