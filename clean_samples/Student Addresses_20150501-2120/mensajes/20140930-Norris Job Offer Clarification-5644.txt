Hi Deanna,

To begin, I would like to apologize for any confusion. There was a small mix-up and we would like to extend an interview offer to you at this time, not the job offer that you have just recieved.

Please note that this is not in any way your fault, nor does it reflect negatively on your interview standings.

Sincerest of apologies,

--
