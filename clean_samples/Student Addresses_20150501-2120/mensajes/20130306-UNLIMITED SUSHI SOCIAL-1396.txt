Hey everyone!

It's time for the unlimited sushi social!!!!

I will email tomorrow (Thursday) at 11AM with 5 spots. The first 5 people to reply will get a spot.
I will email once the spots are all taken.

I will email again Friday at 3PM with another 5 spots. Same deal as before.

Anyone that emails me after the 5 spots are taken and BEFORE I email saying the 5 spots were taken, will be entered into a raffle for the last 10 spots.

If this times do not work for you, email me and I will enter you into the raffle as well.

The social will be on Tuesday, March 12th at Todoroki.  It will take place at 1PM or 5PM depending on the responses of those who end up receiving a spot. If it is at 1PM, it will cost $2 to go. It MIGHT cost $5 to go at 5PM.  It might still be $2, that will be determined soon.

May the odds be ever in your favor,
SB
