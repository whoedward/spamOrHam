Hey guys,

I hope you guys have all survived the first wave of midterms. If you are still powering through them, press on!

Just a couple of things:

1) We have our elections tomorrow, so PLEASE COME TO PRACTICE TOMORROW. I decided that it would be best to have the elections after practice, so about 9:30 P.M.-ish, so even if you're going to be late, please come to practice!

2) We are currently in the middle of grinding out our KASA Show demo. As such, for the next two weeks, during our regular warm-up time, there will be a group of us practicing for the show until Master Kallo arrives. For those who are not part of the show, you are more than welcome to still use the floor space, warm-up, and stretch, get some workout in, but it will likely be more independent than the way we normally do things. I apologize for the inconvenience, and I hope you guys understand for the next two weeks.

See you guys tomorrow.

Yours,
Davin
