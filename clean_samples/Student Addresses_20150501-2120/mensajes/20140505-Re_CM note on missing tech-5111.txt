So from the 4-6 shift Drew and Max were scheduled, then Juan and Alex Y came on at 6.  Since Max wasn't there, it was most likely Drew. We can talk to him at the meeting Wednesday?

    I don't know his name, and I've never seen him around before.

    He was of medium height, very trendy in dress and haircut, and Asian. I hope that helps!

        I'm sorry, I don't. Sarah was actually the one who ended up finding him. I've added her to the email. Sarah, did you happen to get the tech guy's name or remember what he looked like?

            Hey Sean! We saw the note about the tech who didn't answer their walkie on Saturday evening and wanted to follow up about it. 

            Do you know who it was by chance?

            Thanks!
