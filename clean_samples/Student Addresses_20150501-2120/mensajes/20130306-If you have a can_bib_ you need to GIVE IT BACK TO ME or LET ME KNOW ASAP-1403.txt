Hey everyone,
 
I went to early check-in for DM tonight, and we hit a slight snag because, according to the DM people's spreadsheet, ISRC has two more cans and bibs checked out to it than I checked out last quarter.
 
Did anyone go to the DM office on their own and check out a can and bib under ISRC's name?  Or did anyone get a can/bib from me and not give it back?  (I don't think this is the case, but just double-checking.)
 
If you have a can/bib that's checked out under ISRC's name, PLEASE let me know ASAP.  If these cans and bibs don't turn up, we may have to pay for them out of our dorm's budget, which would be a bummer.
 
I live in room 203, if anyone wants to return a can/bib to me.
 
Thanks for helping.
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
