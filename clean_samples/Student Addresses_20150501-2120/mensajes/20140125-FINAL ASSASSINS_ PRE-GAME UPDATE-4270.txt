Hey everyone,

There's some final things I'd like to talk about before I give you all your names:

1) SAFETY PRE-CAUTION: Be careful around icy ground and stairwells. It's great to be excited, but please don't be overzealous around these areas. We really don't want any of you to suffer any injuries from this game.

2) Any ISRC events/meetings are considered safe zones. This includes open exec, closed exec, IFN, and any social that is specified by an exec board member. This DOES NOT include munchies.

3) Remember, the game starts on Monday, January 27 at 9pm. So when I give you your target, kills will not count until this time.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for your targets later today!

Thomas
