Good afternoon all,

 

Please accept this invitation to our first Norris Town Hall of 2015! It is scheduled for Thursday, January 22nd, from 3:30 to 5:30pm, in Wildcat B.

 

With more and more inequities and societal, or  institutional, failures coming to the fore every day, it is both appropriate and, sometimes a civic responsibility, to express dissatisfaction with circumstances, actions, results, or simply with how things are.  Norris University Center is a gathering ‎place where such expression is likely to occur.

 

We would like to discuss how Norris can support free expression and activism while carrying out its mission.   Your perspective and experiences ‎are of great value as we look to best serve the University community. 

 

Best regards,

 

Norris Student Employment Committee
