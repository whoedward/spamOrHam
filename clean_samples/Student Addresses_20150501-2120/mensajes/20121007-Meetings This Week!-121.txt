Hey NUSTARS!

Thanks so much to everyone who came out to the information session on Thursday. We know there were a few other groups with sessions at the same time, so we'll be having a second information session this week for anyone who wasn't able to make the first one (or if you just want to see Dan's video again- I wouldn't blame you).
It'll take place this Thursday, October 11, at 8:00 PM in LR3.

Whether you've been to an information session or not- if you're interested in the Rocketry Team, then come by a meeting tomorrow! The Rocketry Team will be meeting in Ford at 8:00 PM (Monday, October 8). And yes, I'm aware I didn't put a room number there... but don't fret! Once you enter Ford there will be some signs up directing you to the room.

For those of you interested in the Microgravity Team, more information will be coming your way soon.

And thanks as well to everyone who came out to October Sky! I had never seen it before and I think I can say it's now one of my favorite movies. We'll continue to have movie nights every month or so.

Hopefully we'll see you all at the meetings this week!
Peace&Love,
Sam Stahl
