Hello, lovely ISRCers!

If you're doing DM and want to start raising money, ISRC will be canning this Saturday in downtown Evanston from 12-3. See the Doodle Poll description for details. Even if you're not doing DM, sign up for shifts to get philanthropy points! 1 half-hour shift = 1 point. Anyone who participants, DM team member or not, will get points! As of right now, the plan is for the money raised to be pooled into the general ISRC DM team funds.

FILL OUT THE DOODLE!!!!

I'm so sorry I can't can this weekend. It's the Chicago Flute Club Flute Festival weekend, and I have a midterm Monday and another Tuesday. :( But please help out if you have time!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
