        Hey Marina,

        I can take Will's spot or after the meeting tonight!

            Hey Kara,

            Will's doing his eval early--if you want, you can be my first after the meeting tonight (around 8ish or earlier, depending on when we finish).  Lemme know if you're still good with the time you chose, no worries.

            Thanks,

            Marina

                    Sorry Kara, Tim P. has 8:55...  I can still a little after 9 pm, though!  These things should seriously take no more than 5 minutes.

                    For simplicity's sake, I'll lay out those signed up for today:

                    2:00 pm - Max Zhang
                    2:15 pm - Juan Herrera
                    2:30 pm -

                    8:30 pm - Charlie Hoffert
                    8:45 pm - Matt Connor
                    8:55 pm - Tim P.

                    Let me know if I've misplaced or overlooked anybody.  As you can see, there's still some spots left, especially between 2-4 pm.  Thanks for all the cooperation, guys!

                    Marina
