Hello Jennifer,

I am sorry for a late response (there has been a lot of confusion on my part). However, I am scheduled to arrive on campus on the eighth of September. I will be living in ISRC (West Fairchild) in room 321.
Hopefully this is not an issue for you, and if it is I would like to apologize profusely in advance.
Please let me know if you need any information from me.

Best,
Ethan Robison

    Hi all,

     

    Jumpstart is going to be here really soon! Itâ€™s time to start getting excited! Each day is planned from 8:30/9:00-5:00 with outings for dinner on Wednesday and Thursday. Please verify times for area training with your supervisor.

     

    o  September 9-10: ARTica, Center Manager and Operations, Dittmar, Game Room, Mini Courses, Norris Outdoors

    o  September 14-15: Box Office

     

    If you are living on campus, please reply to this email to confirm your early housing information. I know a couple of people needed to move in earlier than they originally thought.

     

    Jenn
