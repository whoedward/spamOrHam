Hello, lovely ISRCers!

A quick correction - if you attend the philanthropy committee meeting this Thursday at 5, you get half a committee point, not half a philanthropy point. This goes for any committee meeting - social, academic, whatever we may have this year. Sorry for the mistake!

ISRClove,
Ayla
