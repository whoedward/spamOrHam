Shining Lives, a musical, at Northlight Theater: It's 1922 and the young women of Chicago's Radium Dial Company are living a dream - earning good wages and beaming with new-found independence. After years of hand painting watch dials, the so-called "harmless" radium leads to devastating results. Four courageous women upend their lives with a determination to change the future in this compelling new musical, the transcendent tale of heroic lives that glowed with promise.   Book & lyrics by Jessica Thebus, Music by Andre Pluess & Amanda Dehnert; directed by Jessica Thebus.

    Event date: Saturday, May 9th (campus departure 6:45p/campus return 10:15p)
