Hey ISRCers,

As Cheryl mentioned in her earlier email, on Friday from 3:30 pm- 4:30 pm in the Main Lounge, we are having an information session about the exec board positions and elections with free food from Mumbai Indian Grill! 

You will be able to learn about the different responsibilities for each position, pick up petitions and talk to the Exec Board members and Master Staff about all the joys and challenges of being on ISRC's Exec Board.

Remember, you can run for any of the 11 positions on the Executive board:
President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Social Chair, Academic Chair, Philanthropy Chair, Fellows Chair, Tech Chair, Alumni Chair, and Eco Chair.

If you are going to come to this event, please RSVP on the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/groups/562828147097447/permalink/661884460525148/?qa_ref=qd). If you can't get on the Facebook group, you can email me back RSVPing. 

Have a wonderful Wednesday!
