I can take all of this event if need be--however, if anyone would like to jump on all or a part of this shift, please feel free.

I know schedules are more than a bit crazy at this early time in the quarter, but I want to thank everybody for being so flexible.

Keep it fresh,

Marina

    Hi NTS,

    We just had a Ryan Event come up for tomorrow from 5-11pm. If you can take all/part of the event, just reply to the email. You won't have to worry about missing the meeting tomorrow.

    We don't know where the meeting will be tomorrow, but be on the lookout for an email tomorrow morning, the time is as usual, 7-8pm.

    Thanks,

    Alex
