Hello my lovely residents!

I have THREE very important things to tell you!

First, I will be putting a sign up sheet for the RCB formal at the Field Museum (occurring Nov. 13). This will go up right after open exec tonight. There is limited space available. Please let me know if you will not be able to add yourself to this sign up sheet but want to attend. Tickets will be only $20 for food and transportation. The ticket policy will be similar to Cross RC events. If you buy a ticket but can no longer go, you cannot get a refund BUT you can transfer your ticket to someone else IF you notify me first.

Second, there is open exec tonight in the main lounge at 8:30PM! Please come to find out what cool things will be happening in ISRC this week.

And lastly, please fill this survey out. (Click on the word survey, it will send you to the link.) This survey asks some very important questions that will allows us (your fabulous exec board) to better serve you (and maybe even give you some yummy surprises!).

Cheers,
Sarah Bridgewaters
