    There is another event with the same equipment at the Great Room at 5PM, so we had planned on leaving it there and Michael Wang would go over to turn it all on.

        As of 11:25 the great room event that ended at 10:30 has not been broken down.  If I don’t hear from anyone I will send a tech on duty over.
