Hi Braelyn and Irene,

This Sunday one of the LCD  TV's was found in the Evans room, leftover from a set-up Saturday that was never cleaned up. As the techs on shift for the Saturday close, you are responsible for sweeping the entire building in order to prevent instances like this. I am writing to let you know that this constitutes a first warning. 

I understand that it may not have been written on the sheets since the set-up was a last-minute write-in, but I would like to emphasize that every single room should be checked when sweeping the building. 

If you have any questions or information about the incident that you would like to express, please feel free to email me. Otherwise, please make sure that this does not occur again. 

Thanks,
Bobby Ramirez
