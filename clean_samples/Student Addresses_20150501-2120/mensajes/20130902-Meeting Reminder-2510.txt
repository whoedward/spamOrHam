Hey guys, just a reminder about tomorrow's (Tuesday) meeting. 4PM! Let's go ahead and plan on meeting in the TGP Alcove for now. 

If you already sent me an email saying you can't make it, then you're taken care of, but if you are not around yet/unable to make the meeting, please email me as soon as possible. 

Thanks!
Bobby Ramirez
