Hey ISRC! 
Come celebrate spring with the rest of J1F at the second annual J1F Block Party this Sunday at 5PM in the Hinman alley! 

There will be hot dogs and hamburgers (vegan and vegetarian options as well) with many delicious condiments. We'll also have fun games like cornhole and frisbee on the Knolls! This event is specifically for J1F residents, so be sure to bring the ticket that your CA will distribute to you in order to get food! 

See you Sunday! 

-Your J1F CAs
