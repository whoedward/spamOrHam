Hey everyone,

The latest I will receive any remaining petitions for exec is 9:00pm tonight, so get your signatures ASAP!

I still have no one running for philanthropy chair. Please consider running for this awesome position.

Thanks everyone, and remember, elections will be this Sunday during open exec!

Thomas
