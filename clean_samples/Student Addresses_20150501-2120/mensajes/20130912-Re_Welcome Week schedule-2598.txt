I'll be a Peer Adviser this year, so I have to commit all of my time during Wildcat Welcome up until that point. I also noted it on the scheduling spreadsheet.  If I do have a shift during that time, I'll just try to get it covered.  Sorry for any inconveniences, and let me know if you need anything else.
