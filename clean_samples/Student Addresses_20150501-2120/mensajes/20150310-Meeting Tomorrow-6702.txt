Hi NTS,

I hope you've had a good reading week so far. Our last meeting this quarter will be tomorrow, from 7-8pm in the Big 10 Room. Please make sure to check your finals schedule and release any shifts you need covered before the meeting. If you can't make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason. 

Thanks,

Alex
