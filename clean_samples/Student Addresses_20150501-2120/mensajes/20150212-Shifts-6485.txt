Hey NTS:

So some of you have been taking the shifts from shiftplanning as people have released them. Unfortunately, the purpose of releasing the shifts was to get them covered at the meeting, and so some shifts are double covered. Please check shiftplanning for the correct schedule. 

Thanks, 
Will
