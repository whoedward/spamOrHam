    Hey all,

    Just wanted to send out another e-mail to remind you guys that basketball is at 7PM tonight! This is our first playoff game, and there's a couple of people from our team that can't make it tonight so if you are willing/able to play please come to the main lounge by 6:40! Even if you haven't played with us before or you haven't played basketball much in general before, please see if you are free tonight and consider coming (I would really greatly appreciate it!!)

    Thank you so much, see yall tonight
    Paul Kim
