Hey everyone!

Because of an extension given by the catering company, the deadline for the RCB formal has been extended!  There are a lot of spots still available.  Please reply to this email if you want to go.

The formal is on Nov. 3. It is from 8PM to 11PM in the Field Museum. Buses will board at 7PM. Tickets are $20!
