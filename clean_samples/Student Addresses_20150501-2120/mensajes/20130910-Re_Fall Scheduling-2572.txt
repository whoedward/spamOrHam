Hi everybody,

Just as a reminder, we need you get your schedules into us ASAP.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdGlFUWd6WDJnVkt3b3haN25RSDJKaEE&usp=sharing

We can't make the schedule unless we have all of your availabilities, so get them in!

If you have problem accessing the sheets, make sure you're logged into your Northwestern email, and if that still does not work ,email me.

Thanks,

Alex

    Hi everyone,

    I hope you're enjoying the last few weeks of break. We're getting ready for the school year, so its time to fill out Fall Classes and Extracurriculars.

    Here's the link to the Google Doc:

    Please remember to indicate your preferred shifts with asterisks and try to estimate how many hours you would like to work during the fall. Also, please tell us when you will be able to start working.

    Please try to get your schedule into us by Next Monday, September 9th.

    See you all in a few weeks!

    Alex
