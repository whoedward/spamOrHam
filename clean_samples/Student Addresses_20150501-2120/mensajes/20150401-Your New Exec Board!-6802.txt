Hello Everyone!

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Josiah Lopez-Wild and I'm ISRC's new President! On behalf of all the Exec Board I'd like to wish you all a great Spring Quarter. We're looking forward to working with you all! A few things:

1. We will be having Exec munchies tonight a little after 9 in the main lounge. It's pizza!
2. You'll be receiving emails in the next week or so about Field Day, which will be coming up this May.
3. Have a great Spring Quarter!

Best, 
Josiah Lopez-Wild
