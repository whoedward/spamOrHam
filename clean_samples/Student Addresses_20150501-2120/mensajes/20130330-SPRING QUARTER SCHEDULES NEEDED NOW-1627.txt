Hey all,

Most of you have filled out your spring quarter schedule on the google doc. Some of you have not. We need those schedules IMMEDIATELY, so we know where we can schedule you. Otherwise you may end up without hours or with hours you do not want. It is shared with all of you under your google drive. The excel sheet has a tab with your name on it, so just fill in your class and known extracurricular schedule. If either schedule is liable to change, fill out what you know now and we'll work out the kinks later. Star the shifts you want most (no guarantees!) Email us with any questions. 

Hope you all have a great last couple days of break!

Best,
Tim

PS: I know seeing work emails this close to the end of break is frustrating, so please do this ASAP so we don't need to send out another one!
