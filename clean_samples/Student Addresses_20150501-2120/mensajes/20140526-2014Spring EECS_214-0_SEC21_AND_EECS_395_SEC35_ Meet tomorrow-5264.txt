Hey Team Juliett!

Let's meet tomorrow from 5-8.  It's fine if you have to come late/leave early.  Meeting place in 3370 in 3N like usual.  Please let me know if you can't come at all.

Also, let's plan on meeting from 5-8 on Thursday and at 1 pm on Sunday.  Our goal was to have the project nearly finished by Friday.  I think we can come close to finishing by Thursday or Sunday if we are productive this week and weekend.  Also, it's important to note that the due date has been moved from the 6th (Friday) to the 9th (Monday) so if we really need that weekend to finish, we have it.  Ideally, let's be done before then.

See you tomorrow.
