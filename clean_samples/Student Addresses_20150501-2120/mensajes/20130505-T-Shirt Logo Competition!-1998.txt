Hey ISRCers,

Remember that cool t-shirt you got at the beginning of the year? Well, if you didn't know already, a previous resident made that cool logo. This year, we want YOU to make a logo for our ISRC t-shirts!

You have until Sunday, May 19th at Noon to make a logo for next year's t-shirt.
You don't need to worry about color schema right now. All you need is a cool looking design that you feel exemplifies ISRC people!

Be creative, have fun! The winner will get a $10 gift card of their choice and a free t-shirt if you're not living here next year or not planning on being a non-res next year!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

Thanks!

Thomas
