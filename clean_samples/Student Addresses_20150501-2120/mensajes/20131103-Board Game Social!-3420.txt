Hello friends!

As much as I love hanging out with you all kicking things in the gym, it'd be nice to hang out outside of TKD training as well.  That way we can get to know each other better.  That being said, I'm hoping to have a board game social this Saturday at my place.  We could all go out for dinner and then head over to my place for some board gaming awesomeness.

Tentative plan:  Saturday, dinner at 5:30, somewhere in Evanston.  Board games at my place, 2531 Jackson Ave. afterwards.

If you're interested in coming let me know!  (Reply to me, don't reply all to the listserv)  If Friday, Sunday, or another time works better for you, also let me know!

Hope to see you there!

Allan
