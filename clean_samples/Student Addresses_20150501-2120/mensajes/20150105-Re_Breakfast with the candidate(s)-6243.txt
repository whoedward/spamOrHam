I've got a 9 AM class on both Tuesday and Wednesday, so I may have trouble making it to them on those days.

        Due to extreme cold we will have breakfast with Geoff at 8am at Dunkin Donuts here at Norris.  We will meet at Clarkes at 8:30 am on Wednesday and Thursday.  If you cannot make one of the breakfast sessions please attend the student portion of the interviews at 12:45 om Tuesday and 1:45 on Wednesday and Thursday. 

         

        Thanks,
