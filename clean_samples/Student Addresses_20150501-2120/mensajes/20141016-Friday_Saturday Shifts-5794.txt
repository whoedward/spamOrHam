Hi NTS,

As a reminder, there is an early open tomorrow morning at 6:30am. Please make sure you are here on time and ready to go. The rooms will be set beforehand but you will need to get them up and running. In addition, we will have VIP guests in the building, so make sure you dress properly and be on your A-game. This means business casual - no jeans or t-shirts if you are working during the day for both Friday and Saturday.

Go 'Cats

Alex
