Hi,

I can't make the meeting tonight because my student group is hosting a panel event tonight. I don't have any shifts to release. I'm sorry about this! If anyone is interested in coming to the panel afterwards it's on sex trafficking in Chicago and we're holding it at Fisk 217 till 9PM!

Thank you,
