        Hello, I have class at that time as shown by the schedule I submitted before the quarter started. I already asked Michael if that was accidental and he confirmed it was probably a mistake during the schedule transfer.

        My shiftplanning schedule should currently be up to date. Sorry if there was any confusion.

            I just wanted to check to make sure that you were aware that you were signed up for the Continuing Ed Tech shift from 12-2 on Thursdays. If there is a misunderstanding, please let us know ASAP.

            Otherwise, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com promptly with a reason as to why you missed this shift.
