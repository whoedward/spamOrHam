Hi Faye,

Let's meet at 2 p.m. on Tuesday (11/11/2014) at Norris. When you get there, just head on over to the Center Desk and let them know that you are there for an NTS interview. They'll give us a call and we'll be right up.

Best,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan,

    I'm available from 1-3 pm on Tuesday and 11am-1pm on Thursday, would either of those times be convenient?

    Thank you!

    Best,
    Faye
