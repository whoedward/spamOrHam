Hi ISRC!

Remember that tonight after munchies, we will be decorating the ISRC homecoming banner for the parade. You will receive a service point for sharing your artistic ability. 

To decide who is going to wear the Pineapple Costume for the parade, we are going to have a drawing. 

Please email me by 10pm TONIGHT if you would like your name to be entered. 

After 10, I will draw a name from all those entered, and that person will get to wear the Pineapple costume. 

Hope you have a great Wednesday. Good luck on any midterms you may have!!

ISRCLove,
Esteban
