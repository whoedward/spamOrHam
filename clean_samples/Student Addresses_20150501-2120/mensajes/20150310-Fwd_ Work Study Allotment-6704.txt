Hey Christine,

So I was just informed today that I am approaching my Work Study Allotment, and cannot ask for an increase. Is there any way Norris can help with this issue? If not, I will have to reduce my hours at Norris to two hours a week most likely, in order to spread my allotment over the whole quarter. If there is anything else I can do, please let me know.

All the best,
