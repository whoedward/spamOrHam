Hey Bobby,

I'm emailing you concerning a couple of things left out/on after last night's (10/7/13) close. In Northwestern A and Rock Room, projectors were left on. In Northwestern B, a cart with an ethernet cable, a remote, and a VGA cable were left out.

According to Shiftplanning, you worked the close last night. I just wanted to double check that this was accurate.

Regards,
Ethan
