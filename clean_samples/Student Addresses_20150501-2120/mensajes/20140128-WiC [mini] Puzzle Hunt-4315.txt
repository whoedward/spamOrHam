Hello All:

Women in Computing (WiC) is hosting a puzzle hunt _this_ Thursday night, 1/30, 6-8pm in Wilks. In case you haven't done one before, puzzle hunts are competitive team events involving fun problem solving challenges such as ciphers, encrypted codes, wordplay, etc.

And why might you care? For starters, prizes for the top teams of 4:
1st Place - 4 FitBits
2nd Place - $25 Gift cards + mugs
3rd Place - $10 Gift cards + shirts

And of course, free food from Potbelly's and swag from our awesome sponsor, Avant Credit.

So bring yo' friends, for some fun CS-themed puzzles with Women in Computing  Everyone is welcome (males and females, undergrads and grads!) and you'll potentially have cool gadgetry and gloating rights afterwards. There's really no downside here.

Please RSVP, FB Event:https://www.facebook.com/events/205721256285657/

Yay for FitBits!!!

Hope to see you this Thursday evening in Wilkinson Lab (M338)!

Thank you,
Women in Computing
