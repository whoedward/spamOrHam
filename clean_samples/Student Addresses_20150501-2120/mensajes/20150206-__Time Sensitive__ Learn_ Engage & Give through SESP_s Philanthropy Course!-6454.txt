> In Spring 2015, Northwestern's School of Education & Social Policy is offering for the third time a great course on the study and practice of philanthropic giving. The course, entitled "Learning Philanthropy: Engaging in the Study and Practice of Giving," will examine the role of philanthropy in the United States by studying its history, social meanings, motivations, and effects. And, with the support of a national foundation, the course will empower students to make a substantial financial gift to the organizations of the class's choosing at the end of the quarter.
>
> This course is open to any undergraduate student interested in civic engagement and the public good. However, space is limited, so students will be admitted based on an application process.
