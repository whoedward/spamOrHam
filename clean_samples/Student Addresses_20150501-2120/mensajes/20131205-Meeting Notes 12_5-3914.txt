Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from last night's meeting:

If you are planning to stay here over winter break and want to work, contact Michael about scheduling - Norris is open until the 21st and there's some pretty easy shifts available.

Our regular schedule is still going until the end of Finals week - if you need a shift coverage during Finals week, please send it out ASAP

Be on the lookout for winter scheduling emails - please fill them out so we can get scheduling for winter done faster
