Hello, lovely ISRCers!

Here's another philanthropy event you can do (I hope I'm not putting out too many options at once!) - It's called Book Buddies! and it's THIS FRIDAY, 3:30-5, at the EPL (Evanston Public Library, close to campus). Here's what the volunteer coordinator for Book Buddies says: You'll receive a brief orientation about reading strategies with young children. Then there will be group story time and after that you'll get to read in small groups with your book buddies! The afternoon will end with an activity that relates to the theme of the week.

It's super fun, but there aren't many spots. EMAIL ME NOW if you want to go. It's first come, first serve, so I don't think everyone who emails me will get a spot. :( I know that sucks, but Book Buddies will happen again at the same time on various Fridays throughout the year. Now, however, is a good time to start volunteering and racking up those philanthropy points. :) Thanks, guys!

ISRClove,
Ayla
