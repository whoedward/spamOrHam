CRC'S 25TH ANUAL: 
RADIOTHON!
"Livin' on a Prayer"
December 3 - 5, 2012

Each year, the Communications Res College hosts RADIOTHON, 50 hours of radio madness and fundraising out of its own sound studios. Radiothon is the 2nd largest fundraiser on campus (after DM) and raises thousands of dollars each year for the American Heart Association and CRC's Radiothon fund. This is done to honor the memory of William G. Arnold, a CRC equipment chair who passed away due to cardiac arrhythmia. 

Radiothon began in 1987, so this is its 25TH YEAR and it promises to be the biggest year yet!

    Tune in to the radio madness here. Not sure when the good part is? There's an event schedule right over here. 
    Call in any time between midnight tonight and midnight wednesday at (847) 467-6464 to get on the action, or contact us here, Tweet at us here, or email us at ___. 
    Can't participate but still want to help the hearts? Donate here (and find out more over here).
