> I have received word that due to colder temperatures in the foreseeable future, facilities is changing the buildings over to heat beginning later today.  It may take several hours for the change from chilled water to hot water to be fully realized throughout the pipes.  This change typically occurs somewhere between October 1 and October 15 each year with input from weather forecasts.  Please note, once the systems change to heat they will not be changed back to air conditioning until the spring.  While I understand (and share) your discomfort when we have a random warm day here and there, please do not email asking for the system to change back and forth on cold/warm days as our pipes simply do not operate like that.  You can turn your systems to "off" if you do not wish heat to come out.
