Hey everyone,

Here's a quick reminder that we have open exec at 8:30pm in the main lounge tonight. Open execs are usually much shorter than the mandatory one you all attended last Sunday, so come by to hear about ISRC news, events, and shenanigans. Especially come if you want to run for secretary!
