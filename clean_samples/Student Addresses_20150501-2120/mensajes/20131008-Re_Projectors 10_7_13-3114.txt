Aliyah,

That's definitely something that happens to all of us. Just be certain to double check that things are shut down and put away. Especially because of the price of porjector bulbs and in light of the recent string of robberies that Norris has had the misfortune to experience.

Ethan

    Hi Ethan

    I was on shift last night, and I take full responsibility for that. We had split up the clean ups on the 8-10 and when Northwestern was locked on my rounds I wrongly trusted that the other tech had done their part.
