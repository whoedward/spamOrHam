Share your feedback on topics ranging from mental health, transportation, sustained dialogue, and accessibility to academic experiences. 

Want to have your voice heard on these issues? Hereâ€™s the survey.

You'll be entered to win prizes such as giftcards to local Evanston businesses!

With more information on student priorities across all schools, groups, and communities, ASG can lobby for more effective policies, create useful services, and improve resources for students and different groups. But we need your feedback to develop innovative resources that respond to your priorities. This is a survey by students for students. 

As this survey is completed and analyzed, we will share it with the entire Northwestern community.  Help us build this story. 

What do you want to see changed? Tell us. 

Feel free to reach out to me at my email below if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for the time and rock those finals!
