Hello Rafael,

I'd like to place an order for the first of the two gi listed (the one listed on the site at $54.00). This, combined with the $35 due, should come to a check for $80.90. If I miscalculated, or forgot to include tax, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ethan

    Hey all,

    A couple of items of club buisness.

        Practice will be at Shinjinkai again this Monday. Mazza Sensei was asked to teach at Shinjinkai for that class, so it will be just as normal but in a much nicer area with a lot more other students to practice with. I realize this is more than our usual trips down there in a quarter, but it is a good thing in my view. Meet at Blomquist at 5pm. We should be back in Evanston by 8:45. Please let me know If you can or cannot make it so I can arrange transportation appropriately. If you come to Shinjinkai, I suggest using the Blomquist space to practice body movement and falls on your own.
        Club Dues - We need to collect club dues, particularly since we wanted to order some replacement mats. Please bring in your dues the Monday after thanks giving. They are $35. Cash or a check to the NU Aikido club please.
        Gi order - Ted was planning to order a Gi for himself ASAP. Please contact him immediately if you want to save on shipping by ordering with him. E-bogu is also having a 15% sale at the moment. I recommend either this gi or this one. Fitting guidelines are on the website and Caroline will bring her measuring tape with her on Monday.
        Blomquist Closed Wednesday  - There will be no practice on Wednesday due to the holiday gym closure. We will have practice on Nov. 26th at Blomquist as usual.

    See you Monday,

    Rafael
