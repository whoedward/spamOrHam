Hello NTS!

Happy March! 

Spring Quarter shifts begin on March 29th, so if you are scheduled for a Sunday shift, get it covered or make sure you are back on campus. 

Scheduling

Like winter quarter, we will be using google docs to determine your availability throughout the quarter. 

Instructions: Fill out the time slots for when you are busy (Classes, club meetings,etc.). The names are at the bottom; if you cannot find yours, please email Will (juwonhyun2016@u.northwestern.edu) and he will put a tab in for you. See the sample as a guideline. If there are shifts that you really prefer to work, mark those with an asterisk. We can't guarantee it, but we will try to accommodate

Please be as honest as possible with your schedule. For example, if you have class from 11am-12pm and from 2pm-3pm, please do not that say you are unavailable for that entire block because you would like to get lunch/nap etc. in between.

Also, please indicate how many hours you would like to work, if there is anything we need to know (if you are taking a quarter abroad, etc.). 

THERE IS A HARD DEADLINE OF 11:59PM, March 18th.
IF YOU DO NOT FILL THIS OUT BY THE DEADLINE I WILL NOT GIVE YOU SHIFTS.
You have been warned.

The Spring Quarter schedule will be updated on shiftplanning by March 21st. 
Also note that our weekly meetings are at the same time, Wednesdays at 7pm. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.
