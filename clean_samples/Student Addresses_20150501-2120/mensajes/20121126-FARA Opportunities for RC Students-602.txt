Hello all,

I wanted to let you know about 3 FARA opportunities open to ISRC students. FARA, or Fellow Assistant Researcher Awards, are projects created by RC Fellows, funded by the Residential College system. Students make $9.50 per hour, or up to $1750 during the academic year assisting faculty in their projects. Though Fellows are affiliated with various RCs, any student living in an RC can apply to any FARA. 

Attached are the 3 research opportunities and the student application.  This year, there are FARA for Religion and Politics in Africa, The Politics of Immigration Integration Efforts, and The Deportation Research Clinic, all interests applicable to ISRC! 


Remember that the deadline is soon, December 5th at 1 p.m., and applications are to be turned into the Residential College Office and NOT directly to the faculty member.


Let me know if you have any questions! 


Best,


Cheryl
