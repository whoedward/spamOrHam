I am totally free tomorrow after 11:00 (I work the Continuing Ed shift). If you'd like, I can meet with you any time.

    I don’t have sample data, but I can show you the overall idea with last year's information. This year, it will be slightly different because a new section has been added (more questions). Are you done with finals? We can talk about it tomorrow or Friday, whenever it's best for you.

    Frank,

    I leave on Saturday. Depending on how your information is stored, this could be a really easy project. Do you have a sample of any data, or is there some time in the next few days that we could meet?

        ‎Hey Ethan,

        If you could help out with creating a macro that would read, sort out through a bunch of info, and format it, that would really help ‎the committee out. When do you leave for break?

        Frank

        Hey Frank,

        At the beginning of the quarter you mentioned briefly an interest in chatting with me about speadsheets (it might have been a lot more, though, I cannot recall). I was wondering if you were still interested in talking about that sort of thing. If you are, please let me know!

        Best,
