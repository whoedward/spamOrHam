Hi ISRCers,

Michael Allen is teaching a seminar titled Public Affairs in PARC History and is a history class covering the last 25 years, with a particular focus on public scandals, affairs, and controversies.  Its aim is to study the changing nature of public affairs especially with the evolution of communications technology and new media in the last 25 years.  I've attached Michael's proposal if you have students who want more information.

It's listed as: 	
GEN_LA  280-4 - 10  on CAESER and meets Wednesdays from 3-5:50 in the PARC seminar room. 

If you are interested, please email Chris Sardo (michaelsardo2011@u.northwestern.edu) for a permission number.

Best,

Jen
