Hello Aliyah,

I'm emailing you concerning a couple of things left on/out after last night's (10/7/13) close. In Northwestern A and Rock Room, projectors were left on. In Northwestern B, a cart with an ethernet cord, a remote, and a VGA cable was left out. 

According to Shiftplanning, you were on shift last night. I just wanted to double check the veracity of this statement.

Regards,
Ethan Robison
