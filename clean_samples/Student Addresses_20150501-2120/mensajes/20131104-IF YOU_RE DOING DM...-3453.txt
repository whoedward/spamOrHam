Hello, lovely ISRCers!

Thanks so much to everyone who signed up for the ISRC DM team!!! The first All-Dancer DM Meeting is this Thursday at 7pm in Leverone (Kellogg). Please come if you're doing DM!!!

We will meet in the main lounge at 6:45 to walk over!

If you're on the team, please email me whether or not you can make the meeting!!!!

The meeting will help you get SUPER excited for DM, and it will address general questions/concerns!!

Thanks so much!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
