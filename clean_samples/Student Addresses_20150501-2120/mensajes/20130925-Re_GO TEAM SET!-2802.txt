Friday I'm theoretically free from 11-3, but I believe I also have a pre-pro with Norris and a run to Public Storage and Home Depot for Mancha, so I probably wouldn't be free until after 4. Depending on how things play out tomorrow I may have time to do a quick rendering, or at the very least dig up some research images. I threw a lot of vague information at Russell yesterday, but hopefully I'll start nailing something down in the next few days.
