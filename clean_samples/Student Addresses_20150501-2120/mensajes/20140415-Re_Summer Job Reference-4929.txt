Thanks so much!

Concerning the experience, I cannot express enough how much I love it here, even if I include the weather (which has been abyssmal at times) in the evaluation.

Concerning "tips," I wouldn't say that I have any specific ones. I recommend the Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago for a good meal, and I recommend South Campus over North Campus for housing, if your son attends NU.

But I am glad to hear that he is considering coming here. Does he know what he wants to study?

    Absolutely

     

    Also, We are sending our son to visit Northwestern in early June.  How has your experience been?  What is "inside" information do we need?

    Hi Mr. Jackson,

    I am applying for a summer job doing IT work for WCPS, and I need a few references.  If it's alright with you, I'd like to use you as one of them. Please let me know if this is alright with you.

    In the meantime, how are things for you at North High?

    Best,
    Ethan Robison
