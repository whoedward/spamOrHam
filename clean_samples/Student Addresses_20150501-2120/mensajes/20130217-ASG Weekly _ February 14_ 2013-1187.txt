> Senate Recap
>
> On Wednesday, Senate called on ASG members and the student body to raise awareness for a Medill alumnus missing in Syria for more than 80 days. James Foley, a freelance journalist, was abducted near the Syrian-Turkish border on Thanksgiving Day last year while reporting on the conflict there, and has not been heard from since; his abductors have not contacted the family either. Please see below for more information and a flyer.
>
> Senate also voted to support the Brady Scholars' senior project, an effort to install a hoop house on campus in conjunction with the non-profit New Urban Leaf Gardens.
>
> Additionally, Senators introduced legislation to amend the ASG Constitution to increase Senate oversight of the Executive Board by elevating the Caucus Whip positions into the Parliamentary Body. The legislation also proposed eliminating the Treasurer position to increase Executive Board efficiency.
>
> A constitutional amendment forum, open to the entire undergraduate student body, will be held on Tuesday February 19th, 7:00PM in the Norris Lake Room to discuss the potential changes.
>
> Student Group Senate positions for 2013-2014 open for application

> Unofficial Study Abroad Guide

> On January 30, 2013, the Northwestern University Associated Student Government passed a resolution supporting these actions (full text here).

These actions are our duty as world citizens and also align with the values of our institution.
