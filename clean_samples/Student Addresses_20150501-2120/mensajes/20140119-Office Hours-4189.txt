Hi NTS,

Just wanted to let you all know when office hours will be held this quarter (this information is also on shiftplanning). Office hours will be:

Monday 2pm-4pm (Tim)
Tuesday 10am-noon (Christina)
Wednesday 1pm-3pm (Bobby)
Thursday 2pm-4pm (Alex)
Thursday 4pm-6pm (Michael)
Saturday noon-2pm (Phoebe)

Remember, you can come to office hours to ask questions, get trained on equipment, voice concerns, or talk to us about anything else that we can help you with. I'd love to see more of you utilize this time this quarter. Keep in mind that tier 2 training must be completed by February 15. Thanks for reading, and have a great night. If you have any questions as always feel free to send me an email.
