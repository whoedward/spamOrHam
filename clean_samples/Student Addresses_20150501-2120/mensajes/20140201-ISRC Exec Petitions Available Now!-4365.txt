Hey everyone,

If you'd like to run for exec, be sure to pick up a petition on my door, 304! They are due by 2/12, so when you collect enough signatures, slide them under my door. If you have any questions about different exec positions and such, feel free to ask any exec members for information.

Thanks!
Thomas
