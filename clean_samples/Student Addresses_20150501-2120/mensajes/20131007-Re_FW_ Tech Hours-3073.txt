Hey Guys,

I am technically free at that time, but I have office hours that I'd really like to attend. If anyone else can take it, I'd really appreciate it. Otherwise, I will.

They are running a visual evoked potential test on me and my doctor wants it done as soon as possible. I have a shift tomorrow from 12pm-2pm. I think I am one of the few people who could work that shift so I don't think anyone can cover me. Can I be excused?
