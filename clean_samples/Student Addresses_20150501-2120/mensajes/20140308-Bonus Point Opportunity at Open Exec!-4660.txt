Hey everyone,

Tomorrow is our very last open exec with our current exec board! While we'll be soon leaving dorm affairs to our great incoming exec board next quarter, we want to hear some feedback from you on how this quarter went. So if you come to our last open exec tomorrow, I will have a short survey for you to fill out. If you hand a survey to me, you will receive A FREE POINT FOR ANY CATEGORY YOU DESIRE. So come by tomorrow for our concluding open exec!

Thomas
