Hey guys,

I built another frame using the curved lips; I can't say that the lanes are evenly spaced (that will definitely be something we'll need to work on) but the structure is definitely a lot more rigid than the first one we built, so hopefully we can use it to progress our design forward more.

Again, I don't want to be working on any prototypes/mockups during reading or finals weeks, so if we could schedule another time this weekend to do so more shop work that would probably be a good idea.

Enjoy your weekend,
Will Krinsman
