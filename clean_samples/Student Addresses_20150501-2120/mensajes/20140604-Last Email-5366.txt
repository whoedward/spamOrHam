Hey guys,

I just wanted to let you know all the things that will be happening for the last few days of this quarter.

1) There is belt testing tonight. Please come during our normal practice time to Blom. If you are testing and need a form, please let me know ASAP. If you are not testing, still consider joining us to support those who are. I'm sure they will appreciate it (we also need some black belts to help out with the test).

2) It seems like there will be two board game night socials this week, one on Friday and one on Saturday. Please fill out the Doodle sheet that Allan has sent out if you haven't already. 

Friday Social Doodle:  https://doodle.com/yq6gp7hzbs7q9isy
 
Saturday Social Doodle:  https://doodle.com/99vadbqnwtpzxbf9

More information regarding location and times to come soon.

3) There WILL be Saturday practice, but unfortunately we are not able to access the trampoline room.

4) During Finals Week, I will be at Blom from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. on Monday and Wednesday if you need to de-stress with something (i.e. kicking stuff, kicking people, etc.). Feel free to join me!

I believe that is it. I just wanted to thank you all for being so supportive and coming out to practices. It was my pleasure to serve you all, and I hope you all have a wonderful summer. For those of you who are leaving us, best of luck in all you do. For those of you who will be returning next year, I look forward to seeing you guys and training together again.

This is Davin signing out.

Yours,
Davin
