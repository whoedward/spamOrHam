    Hey Fadhi,

    There is only one event going on from 12-2.  I think Tim can handle it!  So go home and feel better.

    Hey guys,

     

    Sorry for the late notice but I'm not feeling too well and really need someone to cover my shift today 12-2PM. If anyone can help me out I would really appreciate it. Thanks.

     

    Best,

    Fadhi
