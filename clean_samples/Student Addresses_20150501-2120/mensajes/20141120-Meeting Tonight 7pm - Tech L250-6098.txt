Hey guys!

Hope you are having a fairly good week so far!  We will be meeting tonight same time and place.  This meeting should be shorter than our previous few as we will be brainstorming for a few projects and I do not have a ton of updates from McCormick.

Here is the agenda, please come with some updates on your action items, if you were assigned any!

See ya later!
Jason
