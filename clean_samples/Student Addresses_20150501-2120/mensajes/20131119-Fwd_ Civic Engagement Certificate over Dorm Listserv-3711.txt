The Civic Engagement Certificate is open to all freshmen, sophomores, and juniors and incorporates both community service and classroom learning â€” including five credits of course work and 100 hours of community service.

 First-year students collaborate on final projects related to civic engagement, including this Tumblr that explores the meaning of engagement and this storybook that introduces children to restorative justice and education. Second-year students work together on a Capstone Project relevant to a community organization. 

Applications are due this Friday, November 22 and can be found on the website.
