For those who would like to register for Prof. Roberts' tutorial How Journalist Should Use Political Science to Cover Political News , the class is under the General Liberal Arts course subject in CAESAR (Gen_LA 280-3 - Area III Distro).  To get a permission number for this class to enroll or just to have it in case you could use this class as a back-up, you can email me or Prof. Roberts (aroberts@northwestern.edu). Please let me know if you have more questions. 

Best,
Arkar
