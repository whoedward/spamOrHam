Hey everyone,
 
I just wanted to remind you that DM registration closes at 5 PM today, so please make sure you register before then!
 
As I said in my previous e-mail, DM is a fantastic experience, and for many people, it is one of their most memorable times at Northwestern.  You get to participate in a huge event that really makes a difference for the organizations we benefit.  I highly encourage everyone to do it at least once during their time at Northwestern.
 
The link to register is http://www.nudm.org/register/
 
Please don't be afraid to register because you're not sure if you can raise $400.  I know that sounds like a lot of money, but I promise, it's very doable.  And I will be organizing some dorm-wide fundraisers as well, so you won't be on your own.
 
We already have about 12 people on our team!  Way to go!  Keep registering, and let's make this year ISRC's best DM team ever!
 
Go ISRC!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
