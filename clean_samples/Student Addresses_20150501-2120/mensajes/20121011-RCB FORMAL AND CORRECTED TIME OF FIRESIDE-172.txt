Hello my lovely residents,

I have a correction to make to the email I sent recently about the 'Getting the Most Out of Northwestern' fireside. This is actually taking place on FRIDAY, Oct. 19th at 8PM in ISRC. The time for fireside in Slivka is correct time.

Also, the RCB Formal is on November 3rd (not 13th). It is quite possible that I can obtain roughly a few more tickets as the weeks go on, so please continue to sign up on the wait list. Any non-res members of ISRC should contact me ASAP if they wish to go.

Have a wonderful evening,
Sarah B
