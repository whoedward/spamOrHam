Actually, that time works (2-4 p.m.) just fine. My schedule cleared up.

Best,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan,

    The reason for this is because we generally do not allow changes of pick up times within 24 hours of your scheduled pick up time. However, because your situation is due to a mistake on our end weâ€™d be more than happy to switch your reservation for tomorrow. Please let me know what time slot you would like to be switched into, you should still be able to view available time slots on your account.

    Thanks,

    Xander

    Hi,

    I am trying to change my pick-up time (due to server errors it was
    changed), but it seems that I cannot do so. The advice on the FAQ section
    of the site told me to go to the "Schedule Pick-Up" section and to change
    my information there; however, when i go to this portion of the site, there
    are no buttons nor any links that I can click to adjust my pick-up time.
    Please let me know what I can do to fix this.
