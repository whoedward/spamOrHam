To:


Hello there,
I've attached my guidelines for your Final Reports, along with a checklist you can use (different than the one I stapled in a folder for your team)for the Appendices.

Also, if you are looking for the form for the Design Freeze Document, you will find it under "DTC Documents," and then under "Assignment."

Any questions?

Cheers,

Professor Herrick
