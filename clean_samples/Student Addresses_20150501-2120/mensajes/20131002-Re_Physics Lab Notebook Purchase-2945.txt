    Unfortunately, we are out of lab notebooks to sell this quarter. However, any notebook with graph paper is sufficient for physics lab. I would recommend Norris bookstore as a place to purchase one.
    Sincerely,

        Hello Mr. Godek,

        My name is Ethan Robison, a student in Professor Taylor's Phys 135-2 class. I am in need of a physics laboratory notebook, and Professor Taylor referred me to you.
        As such, are there any notebooks remaining, and if there are, how could I go about purhasing one?
        If there is any information that I can provide, please do not hesitate to ask.

        Best,
        Ethan Robison
