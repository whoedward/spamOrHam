Hi everyone,

Our meeting tomorrow is from 7-8pm in the TGP Alcove. If you do not know where that is, it is the room with the glass doors after you leave the food court. New hires, please try to come so we can get you scheduled. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by noon tomorrow with your reason.

Thanks,
