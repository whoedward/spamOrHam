Hey ISRC!
 
We will be doing canning again this Sunday, May 12, in downtown Evanston for Relay for Life, which is a week from Friday!  The four of us who went last Sunday raised $51 in just one hour! So it's pretty effective. :)  Below you'll find the link to the doodle poll - five half-hour shifts between 12 and 2:30pm, two people per shift. But the truth is that a half hour feels kind of short, so Leena (and probably myself) will be doing a one-hour shift on Sunday.  Feel free to do that yourself. :)  THANKS SO MUCH IN ADVANCE!!!!!!
