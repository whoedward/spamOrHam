Hey guys,

I have you all listed as having not attended any of the new Norris student employee orientation sessions from the past few weeks.  The final session will be this Wednesday, at 6:30pm in the Casbah room (It's inside the Game Room).  It should last about an hour, and you can clock in for your time. Attending one of these sessions is MANDATORY and this is your last chance.

If this time still doesn't work for you, let me know.

See you Wednesday,
Meredith
