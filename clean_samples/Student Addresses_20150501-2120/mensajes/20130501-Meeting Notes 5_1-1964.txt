Hi NTS,

Announcements

Please remember to initial the sheets after every setup/teardown. You don't have to initial both sheets, but remember to keep track of the initialed sheet and make sure it gets on Michael's desk by the end of the day.

If you are on a shift that has an off-site event, we may ask you to go help the person doing the off-site event help setup/teardown if there is not much going on around Norris.
