Hey John,

I just wanted to email you to check up on the closing shift last night (10/18/13).
When I got in this morning, the LED's (spots) were on in McCormick, A/V bag was left in the Hollow, and one of the walkies was not properly in its cradle.
Primarily, this email is to remind you of the importance of tidying up on a close, but it also serves to remind you of your slightly greater responsibility as a returning tech for conveying to Will the proper procedures that we want to have at Tech Services.

If this information is inaccurate, or you have any questions, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com right away.

Regards,
Ethan Robison
