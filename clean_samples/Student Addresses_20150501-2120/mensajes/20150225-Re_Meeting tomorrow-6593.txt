Hey I won't be able to make the meeting tonight.

Let me know if there are any shifts that need to be covered for next week. I am free Tuesdays after 3:20pm and mondays after 1pm.

Thanks

Brett Warner

        So I am currently in Florida and am coming back tomorrow. If my flight is on time I will be at the meeting. If not I will text one of the supervisors that I won't be there. Just wanted to send an email to let you know.
