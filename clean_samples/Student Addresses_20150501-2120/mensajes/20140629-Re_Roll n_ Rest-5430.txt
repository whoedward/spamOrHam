Hey Elizabeth,

I looked through our old emails. I'll forward some of what we have. Do you have our old report?

Hope I can help,
Jonas Carlsson

    Dear Team Three,

    I am an intern working with the Segal Design Institute this summer. My fellow interns are copied on this email. We are looking into your Roll n' Rest project. It would be a great help if you could share with us any documentation or videos you may have.

    Thank you for your help,
    Elizabeth McTighe
