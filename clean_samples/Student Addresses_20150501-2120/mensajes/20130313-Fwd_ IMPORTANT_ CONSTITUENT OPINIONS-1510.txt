Hello Residents of CRC, ISRC, and Jones!

I hope your Reading Week has been going well(for those who have it, that is. Sorry McCormick. And Bienen. And SESP. Actually everyone but Weinberg.) This is going to be a longer email, but please PLEASE PLEASE read it, as it is important, and if you don't, then don't complain.

Last week, I fantastic group called LEND came in and spoke to Senate about gifting them $3,000 from the Senate funding pool. LEND is a micro-financing club/group that was started and is run by NU students. They give out micro-loans to businesses in Evanston that need startup money, or to revamp their businesses, etc. They have an impeccable record of repayment, and they do charge interest on the loans, so they are growing. However, they need more immediate sources of money so that they can finance some new loans and expand. Back in the day(like 2 years ago), ASG funded them $1,500 to help with startup. 

A concern was raised by a fellow Senator however, and I thought I would ask your opinions on it, such that I can vote for you(cause that's how this is supposed to work). His concern is this: while the idea is a great one that improves University relations with Evanston, builds a better community, and creates a lot of great opportunities and experience, the money is not TECHNICALLY going to the University in the end, and as such, should ASG be spending their(READ: YOUR) money to fund it? 

So, please let me know by email, text, Facebook, smoke signals, carrier pigeons, etc., because I need to know what you guys want so that I can do my job effectively!

Thanks for reading my long email(and for those who didn't...rrgh.),

Your Senator,

Eric Morales
