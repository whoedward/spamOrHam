Dear Students,

Please note the change in the TA office hours on Blackboard. In order to accommodate the high volume of students at office hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, we will no longer have Wednesday office hours. Instead there will be additional TAs available during high-volume times.

Best,
Wylie
