Hello ISRC!

Here is an opportunity for an off campus philanthropy event! We are trying to get a group of ISRCers to sign up to help build a house with Northwestern Habitat for Humanity on Saturday, November 1st. If you would like to go, please fill out this form and check the Nov 1 box. In the comments, say that you would like to be with me so we can all work at the same site.

Let me know if you sign up, so I can get an estimate of who is going!

ISRClove,

Ellen
