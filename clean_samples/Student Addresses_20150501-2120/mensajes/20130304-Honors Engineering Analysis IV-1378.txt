Hello Heather,

I am emailing you in regards to a permission number for enrollment in honors EA IV. Due to several delays in enrollment (confusion with other courses, etc.), I was unable to correctly select an EA III class that would not conflict with EA IV or my organic chemistry lab. Because the EA classes are relatively large, I am hoping that you will be able to also help me with enrolling in an EA III section at 12:00, as this is the only time that works.

Since this is an EA conflict email as well as a permission number request, here is the relevant information:

ID: ecr867
Conflicts caused by:
Honors EA IV 11:00-11:50
Organic Chemistry 230-2 1:00-6:00 (Fridays only)

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
