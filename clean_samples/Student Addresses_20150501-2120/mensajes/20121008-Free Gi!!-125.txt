Hi everyone,

Many of you don't know me, I'm a continuing studies student with a jiu-jitsu problem. Now that the school year is going again, I wanted to let people know about what I'm doing. I'm working towards launching a gi company with a social mission but I know nothing about how to make websites or how to make them pretty. So if anyone knows how and has the time to work with me, I can give them a new gi to help me out. Right now I just have a wordpress blog. http://jitsforall.wordpress.com/

I also have some blank gis that I am selling in the meantime. They are plain white A-2 and A-3, come in a variety of weaves and weights, and are only $80. These gis are made for BJJ, but are durable enough for Judo.

If anyone has any interest in the project let me know,

Ben
