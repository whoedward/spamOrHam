Hey Guys,

Since it's important to lead by example, I'd like to remind my fellow supers that we alos need to respond to shift coverage/swap emails, even if we cannot participate in them. Remember that we follow those rules, too. No hard feelings, since I know that Jumpstart was a heckuva lot.

Best,
Ethan
