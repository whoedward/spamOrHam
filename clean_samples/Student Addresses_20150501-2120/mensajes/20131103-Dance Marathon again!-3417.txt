Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I'm sorry I didn't make this clear before, but this is really important: If you registered for the ISRC DM team, email me, even if you think I already know!!!! Thanks so much! Also, if you want to know more about fundraising for DM, come to the Philanthropy Committee Meeting tonight at 8:50 or 9 in the main lounge! It's right after Open Exec - and the committee meeting is open to all, not just committee members! :) THANK YOU!!!!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
