Hey everyone, hope your weekend is going well,
Just wanted to tell you a little more about the Mitsua social we will be having a social next weekend on November 17th to take a trip to the Mitsua Marketplace in Arlington Heights. Mitsua is the largest Japanese supermarket chain in the world specializing in Japanese foods. It also has a food court/bookstore/pottery store/pastry store/ice cream store.  (http://www.mitsuwa.com/tenpo/cica/eindex.html). 
Before we get on the bus, Professor Lyons from the Japanese department, will give a 15 minute talk about the marketplace, so we can appreciate it more. Depending on how many people from ISRC come, lunch at the social will be subsidized around $10. We will leave ISRC at 11AM and get back around 3PM. 
Email me now if you want to go and I will put your name on the list. Signup for this social will go differently than the other ones, if you can go and interested in going email me and I will put your name on the signup list. We are planning on taking around 20-25 students. If the list goes over 25 people, I will randomly pick 25 people and email you on Wednesday whether you have a spot. 
Have a great weekend and Go cats!!!!
Anthony
