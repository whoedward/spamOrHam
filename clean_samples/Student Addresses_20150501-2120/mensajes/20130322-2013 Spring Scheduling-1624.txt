Hi NTS,

I hope everybody did alright on finals and are enjoying their break so far.

The Google Doc for spring Scheduling is the same as before, with each sheet locked except for your own. The sheets are located on tabs at the bottom of the page. If you cannot edit your sheet, make sure you're logged into your Northwestern email, and if you still can't get in, email me and I'll get it fixed ASAP

Important things

Since it is spring quarter, some of you may be coming up on your work-study allotment. To check how much money you have left to earn, go to Caesar ----> look at the Student Financial Services Box, click on the more financial aid link -----> click on work study by year, then type 2013.

Take the amount you have left and divide that by your wage, which should be around $8.30~$8.50 depending on how long you've worked with NTS, that should give you the amount of hours you have left before your allotment runs out. Please take note of this and figure out how many hours you can/want to work each week and put it on your sheet somewhere. Don't forget we also have Ryan Events and Rotations.

If you're running low on work-study, make sure to email the work-study office and ask for more money; they will almost always give you more.

In addition, please indicate on your sheet somehow your preferred shifts. We will try to get you the shifts that you want, though we can't guarantee anything.  If you don't put your preferred shifts on your sheet, you will be first in line to get opens/closes.

Here's the link to the Google Doc

Please fill out your sheet by Saturday March 30th at midnight. The sooner it gets filled out the sooner we can get a schedule out for next quarter

Have a great Spring Break!

Alex
