What up homies,

BJJ will be continuing on Sundays from 11am-1pm from now on. Come get your grapple on to clear your head from whatever you did Saturday night! (I train with a guy back home who use to come into weekend practices completely hung over and still whoop all of us).

Again if you can't make Sunday practices but want to continue with BJJ, send me an email and we'll try to work out a few practices you can make it to.

Hope to see you all Sunday,
Jacob
