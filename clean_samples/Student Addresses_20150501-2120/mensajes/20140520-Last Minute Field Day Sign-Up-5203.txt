Hi ISRC, 

I want to make sure that as many residents as possible are participating in the RCB FIeld Day events. If anyone did not sign-up for one of the competitive (meaning it's for points) events, and WANTS to, please email me by TONIGHT @ MIDNIGHT. 

There is still some room for more people to participate in the Relay Race and Tug of War.

Remember, even if you do not sign up for one of these events, there are still fun activities to do such as a bounce house and an obstacle course! Plus not to mention food and music!! 

Field Day is this Saturday, and trust me it's going to be AMAZING!! 

Best,
Esteban
