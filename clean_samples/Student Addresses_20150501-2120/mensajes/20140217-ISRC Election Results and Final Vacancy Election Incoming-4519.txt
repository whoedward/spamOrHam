Hey everybody!

Thanks for voting! Here are the results of the election:

All proposed changes to the ISRC Constitution have been approved! Changes to the ISRC Constitution shall be taken into effect immediately.

Here are your new exec board members. They will enter into office at the start of Spring Quarter:

Eco Chair: Kylee Grant
Alumni Chair: Tim Suh
Fellows Chair: Coretta Lemaitre
Philanthropy Chair: Ellen Goff
Social Chair: Young-Hoon (Paul) Kim
Academic Chair: Dalit Hendel
Treasurer: Lucy Kalar
Vice President: Rohan Prakash
President: Esteban Doyle

We're not finished yet. We still have 2 open positions: secretary and tech chair. Any candidates who were not elected in the main election may choose to run for either position without turning in a petition. If you were not a candidate in the main election and you would like to run for either of these positions, I will be accepting petitions for those positions until Wednesday at 9pm. They will be outside of my door soon.

Again, congrats for our new exec board! We look forward to your free labor for ID (wait, did I say that out loud?)!

Ciao,
Thomas
