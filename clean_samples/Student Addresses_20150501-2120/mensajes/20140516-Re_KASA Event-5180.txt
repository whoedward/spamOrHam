Hey Jolo,

On our AV Board, it says their reservation for the equipment does not start until 5PM.  If they think this is wrong, then have them check their reservation confirmation email (it could've gotten entered wrong for our sheets).  If this is correct, though, I suppose see if they can make it one more hour.

Thanks, Christina
