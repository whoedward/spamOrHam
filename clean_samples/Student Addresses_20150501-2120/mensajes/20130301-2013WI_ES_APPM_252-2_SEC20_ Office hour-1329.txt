Class,

Unfortunately I won't be able to have an office hour today. Let's schedule one for next Tuesday. Please visit the following poll to indicate your preferred times, being careful only to respond if you think you'll attend.

I'll collect the responses and get back to you on Monday about the time and location of the office hour.

I encourage you all to proceed as if the assignment is due on Monday. There will be another one coming up soon, and not long after that will be your final exam.

Thanks,

Karna
