Hello!

Thank you for applying to the McCormick Student Advisory Board!  We would like to invite you to interview with the board.  The interview will last between 15-30 minutes and will not be super formal (no need to dress up).

The exact location is TBD and I will send you a personalized follow up email with the exact date and time of your interview.

Please fill out the doodle and select all the possible times that you can interview (that way it will be easier for us to schedule everyone).

If you are unable to make any of the times listed, or if you have any questions comments or concerns, you can reply to this email or email my co-chair Michael Wang.

Hope you all are having a good week!

Jason Arnold and Michael Wang
MSAB Co-Chairs
