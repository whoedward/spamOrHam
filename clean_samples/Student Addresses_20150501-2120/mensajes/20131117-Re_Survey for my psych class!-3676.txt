    Hey Ethan!

    I have a huge favor to ask of you. In my Research Methods for Psychology class, we're conducting a survey that I can tell you more about after you take it (if you want to know!). I have to get at least ten Northwestern students to complete the survey, but I'm allowed to take a convenience sample. :) Would you mind taking my survey by Monday at noon? It will probably take you 5-10 minutes. And at the end, please enter the code AJG-10 so I get credit. Getting 10 people to respond is 10% of my grade for the project!

    Just shoot me an email back if
    a) you just finished the survey (yay! you're awesome!)
    b) you don't want to take the survey (which is totally fine - you're still awesome!)

    THANKS SO MUCH, NO MATTER WHAT!

    Best,
    Ayla
