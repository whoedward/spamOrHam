Hello Professor Roberts,

My sincerest apologies that you never received anything. Hopefully you do not mind reading one a little bit after all of the other pieces. Attached is the document in question.

 Logical Fallacies Assignment

    Hi Ethan,

    Did you ever get me your short piece looking at an article that uses one of the arguments we discussed a week ago (ie, the Green Lantern Fallacy, the slippery slope, etc)? If you did, could you send me another copy. If you didn't could you write something up for me. It only needs to be a page or two.

    Thanks,
