Hello Michael,

I am emailing you because the VGA cable at the Ryan auditorium podium is not working properly. It cuts in and out when plugged into laptops.

Note that I mean the VGA cable from the mobile podium, not the VGA at the desk with the resident computer.

If you need any additional information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ethan
