    Hullo everyone too,

    Same thing for me. My parents are making plans to drop some stuff off when it's convenient. I'll give then your email addresses.

        Hullo, everyone.
          I am getting ready to leave for Spain pretty soon, so: Ethan and Mike, I'm going to give my mom your email addresses so that you can coordinate the delivery of my contributions (as listed in my prev. email.) Expect an email from her shortly.
          I hope you are all enjoying the summer vacay.
