Good evening all,

I'd like to send an e-mail to the residence halls on behalf of our campaign. 

Please forward the email below the image (including the image itself) to your listservs, or let me know if there's anything else you need from us in order to get these forwarded out. 

Thanks,
Alex Deitchman

Good evening,

I’m Alex Deitchman, and I’m running with Ronak Patel for the positions of ASG President and EVP. I’m the current off-campus caucus whip, but I’m not running as an off-campus student, I’m running as a student leader and I want to represent all students. That’s why I’m writing to you tonight. As on-campus residents, you’re members of a community that always has its finger on the pulse of student activity at NU. You’re constantly engaged in the issues that matter and vote for representatives as a unified constituency. I’ve worked closely with you and the representatives you’ve sent to ASG both in Senate and on the Student Life and Community Relations Committee.

Residence hall issues and concerns lie at the heart of what it means to be a Wildcat. I’m asking for your input because I want my presidency to be one that never loses sight of a mission to serve all students. I’m not going to flood your listservs with ingratiating appeals to vote for us because we’re fun or because we have a lot of friends in your residence hall. That’s not who I am and it would waste your time. I’m writing because I want to let you know that if you want a president and EVP who will shut up and listen to you, a team that will always put service before any of their personal goals, you have a ticket running for you in Alex Deitchman and Ronak Patel.

OUR PROMISE:

ASG is not something we do for fun. It can be fun, but that isn’t the goal. ASG is unlike any other student organization in that it’s not about us. It’s about the students we serve and their needs. We promise to only make commitments we can deliver - and deliver them. No gimmicks. No blowing smoke. We will never take a single vote for granted. We’re asking for your vote because we’re here to work for you.

Your concerns and input are always welcome. Please visit us on Facebook at facebook.com/DeitchmanPatel or on the web at http://alexandronak.com. If you’d like to get in touch with us or are interested in helping out with the campaign, you can e-mail me at ad@u.northwestern.edu or Ronak at rp@u.northwestern.edu . We look forward to hearing from you.

Go Cats,


Alexander Deitchman

Off-Campus Caucus Whip, ASG Senate

President, NU Veterans Association
