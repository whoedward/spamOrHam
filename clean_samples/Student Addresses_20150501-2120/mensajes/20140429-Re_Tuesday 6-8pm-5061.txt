    Hey guys,

    Sorry for the late notice, I know I was supposed to get this covered 24 hours in advanced, but can someone cover my 6-8pm tomorrow? I really need to be at an event tomorrow during that time period so can someone do me a solid favor!? I will trade you for any shift (provided I don't have class or practice then..)!

    Thanks!
