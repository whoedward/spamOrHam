Hey, guys,

Just a couple of things. We will only be having practice on Monday (today) this week because of the Thanksgiving break. Make sure to really enjoy this last stretch of break before finals start kicking in :)

Also, the tournament testing is less than two weeks away. It will take place at Patten Gymnasium on December 8th (Sunday), and we will start setting up for the event at 10 A.M. that morning. For those who are planning on testing for a new belt, this is the time and location.

With that said, I also just wanted to sincerely ask if any of us would be up for volunteering to help out even a little bit for this event. I imagine the test to be time-consuming as a whole (And it's the day before finals week! Yikes!), but if we could really get people to help out a little bit here and there, I think we could significantly mitigate the impact of this event. We're probably going to have to move mats, guide people around in the parking lot, help with the testing (for the more senior-ranked members), and run other errands. Even if it's just something as simple as moving mats, we would really appreciate all the help that we can get. I'll update you guys on the final details of what we need to do, but if you would be willing to contribute even a few minutes of your time, please let me know so that we can get a better idea of how to organize things.

Also let me or Natalie know if you'd rather test for a new belt on the Wednesday of reading week.

That is all for now. I wish you guys all a safe travel and a great time of Thanksgiving.

Yours,
Davin
