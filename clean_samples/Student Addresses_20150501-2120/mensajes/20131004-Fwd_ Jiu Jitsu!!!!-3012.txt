Hello potential Jiu Jitsu masters!

This email has arrived in your inbox for 2 reasons:
1) To get you psyched about doing jiu jitsu
2) To tell you when we will be practicing and what you need to do before hand so that you can satisfy psyched-ness about doing jiu jitsu.

To get psyched about jiu jitsu, I recommend watching these. Definitely, watch the first one. If you're not convinced then watch some or all of the other two.
This one is about a 9 year old choking out a dog that attacked a girl!
Here's one about why jiu jitsu is relevent for women's self defense.
This last one is classic demo by two Jiu Jitsu legends.


Alright now that you're super excited there are a few things you need to know.

When practice is
Practice is this Sunday from 11am-1pm. I thought we were from 12-2pm, but our time was changed. I apologize if this is problem for you. If it is, let me know and I will try to change it.

Where practice is
Blomquist Gym in the area with the mirrors. Blomquist is across the street from plex.

What you should bring
We practice no-gi jiu jitsu. So, all you need to wear is comfortable clothes. I wear basketball shorts and a t-shirt. You can wear under armour type shirts if you want. You will have to take off any jewelry before practicing.

Also, if you have a mouth piece, bring it. If not, no worries I will have a bunch extra and we'll get more if we need to.

Last, you must bring enthusiasm. It is required.

What you need to do before practice
Before showing up, you need to fill out this form. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is on the bottom right corner of the first page.


Super excited to see you on Sunday. Reply to me directly if you have any questions. I'll send out a reminder email Saturday night.
peace,
Jacob
