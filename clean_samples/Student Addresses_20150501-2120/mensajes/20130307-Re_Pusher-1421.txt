We made the pusher so it fit in the frame, but it doesn't have any felt on it. I think we might want a higher quality version for our final prototype, but this will work to learn our methods and test how fast it is.

The steel thickness is I think 1/32" but I'm not sure, nor am I sure where the catalog for ordering is...

I think the 12 lane pusher is the easiest to "sell." It sounds good on paper and looks good on a poster, it would be a shame to settle for a product that is really pretty useless after all the time we've spent on this, but at the same time I still don't know how feasible it is, how easy it would be to align the frames, and if it would time and time again get every nut and bolt into its correct cup.

The only way to really know is to make one and test it, but we'll have to have a real meeting to discuss what we want to do here.

    Did you guys manage to make a pusher with felt slits this morning? I apologize again for leaving early.

    Also,

    1) What is the thickness of the steel we used for the frames?

    2) does anyone know where to find the McMaster Carr catalog to order the steel? We still need at least two more frames, right?

    Assuming we still want to do the 12 lane pusher which, I don't know if we really want to still or not.
