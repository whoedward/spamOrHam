Senate Recap

On Wednesday, Senate approved the purchase of four (4) new MacBook chargers for the University Library's successful laptop charger program, which began last Spring with the donation of six (6) chargers from ASG. The cost--slightly over $300--will be funded by the Senate Project Pool.

Senate also designated a three-member working group to investigate the feasibility of buying chargers for PC laptops, and distributing all types of chargers to other library branches.

After initial introduction and debate, Senate will vote next week on a resolution exhorting the University to consider divesting its endowment of coal-related investments. The divestment resolution was presented by members of the ASG Sustainability Committee and is co-signed by administrators, faculty, and student leaders.

Senate also heard introductory statements from authors of resolutions regarding firearm regulation and the Senate's legislative scope regarding political issues.

Senators also confirmed two new members of the Student Groups Committee, which provides B- and T-status student groups with auditing, advising, and funding recommendations. Senator Alex Lower, a sophomore, and Danny Kim, a junior, were selected to join the SGC.

The application for the Financial Vice President was also released (available here). The application is due at noon on February 9th.
