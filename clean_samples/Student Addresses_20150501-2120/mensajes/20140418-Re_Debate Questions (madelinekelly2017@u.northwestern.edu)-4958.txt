Also if we could make sure my other source is good, that would be great. It has .gov in it, so I think it is legtimate, but I want to make sure

    Hey Guys!
     
    I edited this to include the rest of the people in the group and added a few words to the questions. If we could look it over for grammar and resend it to Professor Nichols, that would be awesome.
     
    Thanks.
     
    Sincerely,
    Maddy Kelly
