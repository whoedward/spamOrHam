Spring quarter CCI Seminar: The Economics and Politics of Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment

 

 

Monday evenings, 5:30 PM – 8:30 PM, CCI seminar room

 

Fulfills area III (Social and Behavioral Science) distribution requirement.

 

Course description/goals: While those going in to the field of mental health typically think about it as a “helping profession”, there is much more than meets the eye when it comes to the economics and politics that have defined the development of the field. The purpose of this course is to explore some of the historical and economic forces that have shaped the field as it exists today.  The course will particularly focus on the evolution of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its 5th edition), and some of the problems that have emerged from the disease-based framework utilized in the manual.  The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally will be discussed. Finally, the course will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the history of state hospitals and the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the late 1970s/early 1980s.

 

Key themes/questions:

o   How has the consumer mentality impacted our understandings of mental illness and mental health?  What has that impact been?

o   What is the impact of the globalization of American ideas about mental illness?  How is this affected by marketplace forces?

o   What are the forces driving the high rates of psychiatric diagnoses in our culture? What are the implications of these diagnoses – economic, political, individual, etc.

o   What factors have contributed to the radical shifts in the way that our culture handles mental illness?  How have economic and political trends shaped these changes?

 

Course assessments (tentative):

·       5-6 discussion questions (posted on blackboard, less than 1 page each); co-leading class discussion
