    Hello Professor,

     

    I am Ethan Robison, a student in your career development class. Attached are my resume and cover letter drafts. I hope that you will excuse their lack of general form; I used recently created documents that I made for an application which I recently submitted.

     

    Thanks,

    Ethan
