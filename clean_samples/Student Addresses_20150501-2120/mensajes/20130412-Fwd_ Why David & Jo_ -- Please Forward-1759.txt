What We Want To Do

Our meal plans aren't transparent or fair. Let's make impactful changes now, and take action on long-term reform to make meal plans sensible.

We need to equip CAPS to succeed, and engage the student community in enhancing mental health.

Shuttles should be better timed, more punctual, and easier to track. And let's add warmers at the most popular stops.

Let's increase the Student Actitivities Fee by $4.50 to double the funding of 91 B-Status student groups.

Experience in and out of ASG.
Combined, we have three years of experience on ASG Exec.

Equally as important, we have led in these organizations on campus.

We want your endorsement.
