    Hi ISRC!

    I'm excited to announce that ISRC will be hosting our own Thanksgiving Dinner in the Main Lounge for those who are not going home for the holiday. 

    In order for us to make sure we have enough food for everyone, please fill out this form. Indicate if you are staying here for Thanksgiving, and if you are interested in celebrating the holiday with us.

    Best,
