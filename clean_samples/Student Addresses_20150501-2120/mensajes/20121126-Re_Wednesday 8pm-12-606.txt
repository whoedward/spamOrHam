    Hi NTS!

    Sorry this is so last minute but is anyone able to cover my shifts from 8-10 and 10-12 this Wed. night. My senior design project is due this Friday and my team desperately needs to meet in the chE lab during that time every night we can this week to complete our project. I will be extremely grateful and am willing to cover some of your shifts next week. 

    Thanks a bunch!
    Jacob T.
