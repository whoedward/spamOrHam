Hey Everyone,

AIChE is going to be doing things differently this year. We are going to start having bi-weekly chapter meetings for the members of AIChE. The first chapter meeting will be this Monday September 30th at 5pm Tech Plaza (behind Tech Express).

From now on we will be using this AIChE listerv to remind members of chapter meetings and announce upcoming events.

Best,
Mark
