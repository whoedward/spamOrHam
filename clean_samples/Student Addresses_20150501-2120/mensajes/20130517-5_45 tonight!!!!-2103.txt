Hey ISRC,
 
Okay, I'm not changing the time - I will be in the main lounge at 5:45 tonight ready to walk over to SPAC for Relay for Life!  You don't have to eat beforehand because there will be dinner at the event!  So if you are free, please please meet me at 5:45 so I have company. It will be fun. I promise. :) :)
 
Thanks!
~Ayla
