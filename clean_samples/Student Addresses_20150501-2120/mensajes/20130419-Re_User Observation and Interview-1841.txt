Jonas,

I just now got this. My apologies if it was even remotely difficult. If you need any additional help (although I am sure that you managed quite fine), let me know.

Best,
Ethan

    Hey Ethan, 

    I got started on the document. I am using the Cient interview Summary and User Observation Summary appendices. I am going to be working for the next hour, so if you want to continue it, that would be good. Also, we should get it done by tonight, so that Evan and Mitch can fill it in.

    See you later
