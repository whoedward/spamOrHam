Dear Student,

 

We are writing to you from the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid regarding your 2014-15 financial aid award.

 

As of this morning, you have not yet responded to your federal loan offer. You must accept the loan(s) so that we may proceed with processing, or decline the loan if you do not wish to borrow the loan(s).

 

Please go online via CAESAR to accept or decline your loan (Student Financial Services > Accept Decline Financial Aid).

 

You should also review your To-Do item History to check for any other outstanding loan items (Student Financial Services > To Do Item History).
