All,

I promised my lab section that I would check with the other TAs / Prof. Kao about what you all need to know about FFTs / DFTs, since they are pretty crazy complicated. The answer pretty much as expected: the close details about FFTs are not necessary to know super well, but you should know what it is, basically how it works, and when you use it. Saying that "we can solve this problem using FFT" is not quite sufficient -- it's a technique and you can and should describe when to use the technique, while keeping in mind that the technique itself is not an algorithm or solution to your problem. If you lost points on the homework, you'll need to explain more clearly. If you got full points, you're pretty good.

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy studying.

Cheers,

Kevin
