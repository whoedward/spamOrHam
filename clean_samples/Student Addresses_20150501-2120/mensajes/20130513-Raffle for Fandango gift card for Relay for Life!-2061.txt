Hey ISRC!
 
In case you haven't heard, we are selling $2 raffle tickets for a $25 Fandango Gift Card until Friday!!!!!!  ALL the proceeds go to Relay for Life - I donated the gift card, so we don't even have to cover the cost of that. :)  Contact me or Eric if you want to buy a raffle ticket.  You can give the money to either of us.  If I'm not in my room (115), just slip the money under my door in an envelope with your name on it.  Thanks so much!
