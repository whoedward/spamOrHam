Hello Sir,

I am emailing to inquire as to the procedure that one might follow to obtain shop materials (stock, etc.). In short, is there a sufficient supply available that I may simply use raw materials without prior approval or notice (within reason). If I may not, how might I go about ordering or garnering these items ahead of time? As well, what is regurarly available in the shop, if anything is?
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Many thanks,
Ethan Robison
