Calling all EECS students,

A new website has been launched today featuring Northwestern startups of any stage or size. The website is called LaunchQuad and it aims to connect and provide resources for the entrepreneurial community on campus. 

Sign up at launchquad.com (takes 30 seconds). In addition, if you have a venture (of any size or stage), you can create a post on the site.  

If you wish to know more about LaunchQuad here is an article that The Daily published today. Below is a short informational flyer.
