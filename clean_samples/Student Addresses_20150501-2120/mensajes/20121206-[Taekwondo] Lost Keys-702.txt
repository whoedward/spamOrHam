Hey everyone,

Yong lost his keys at the end of practice last night. If you found a set of keys on a purple lanyard that is not yours, please tell Yong or tell me. Or, even better, if you happen to have said keys, please give them to Yong or me.

See you all (or at least most of you) Saturday!

Ji-hoon
