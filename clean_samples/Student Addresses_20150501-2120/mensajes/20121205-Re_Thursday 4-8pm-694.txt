                Hey guys,

                Sorry to clog your inbox with another shift coverage email, but could anyone cover me this Thursday from 4pm-8pm? I have an event that night and won't be able to come in. If no one can cover the whole thing, can someone at least take 6pm-8pm? That's the only part I really need.

                Thanks!
