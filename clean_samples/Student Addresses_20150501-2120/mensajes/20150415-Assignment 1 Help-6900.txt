Hi Dr. Horswill,

I am Ethan Robison, a student in your 4:00 395 class. I spoke with you after class today about the assignment, which was helpful. However, I am still having trouble figuring out the solutions to some of the exercises.

I was wondering if I might be able to get an extension on the assignment so that I can finish it properly. And, even if that isn't okay, I was wondering if you have any time tomorrow or Friday when I could meet with you so that I can up to speed with the syntax of the language.

Let me know if you need any information from me. Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
Ethan Robison
