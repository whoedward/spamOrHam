Hi Supervisors, 

Hope you are all doing well!

Sorry I can’t make meetings this quarter, I know that’s a big pain. I had two things I wanted to talk to you about.

My Monday this week (the 13th) from 10am-noon doesn’t look like it got covered on shiftplanning. I really need that covered because I won’t be in Evanston, so if you could let me know what’s going on with that I’d appreciate it. 

I think we said we were planning on hiring some new people this quarter. If you are looking for shifts to give up, I would love to get rid of any of my Thursday 8am-noon shifts. 

Thanks!
