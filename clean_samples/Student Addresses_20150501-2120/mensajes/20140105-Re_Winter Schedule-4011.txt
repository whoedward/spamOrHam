I sent this via Shift Planning already but my flight got moved and I can't make any of my sunday shift (6 pm -12 am) so if anyone could take it or parts of it that would be great!

                Hey everyone,

                Sorry to be the first request of the quarter, but I have an interview this Wednesday at 6pm in downtown Chicago, so I can't make my 4pm-8pm shift. Can someone cover me? I also sent it via Shiftplanning.

                Thanks!

                    Hey guys,

                    The tentative schedule for the quarter is up on Shiftplanning - its effective starting tomorrow, but we only need one person per shift tomorrow.
                    If you have any conflicts/complaints for shifts before Wednesday, send them out on the listserv and put them up for trade on Shiftplanning, otherwise we'll sort it out at the meeting on Wednesday

                    See you soon,

                    Alex
                    Hi everyone,

                    The first version of the winter schedule is up on shiftplanning - if you have any conflicts/complaints email me and I'll work it out.

                    Thanks,
