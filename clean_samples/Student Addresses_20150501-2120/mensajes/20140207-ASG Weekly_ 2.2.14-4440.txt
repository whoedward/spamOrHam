Applications to join are open! SABSA was launched as a joint venture between the Study Abroad Office and ASG in January of 2014. Board members work to support and create recommendations for the Study Abroad Office and to improve access to, knowledge of, and the overall experience of education abroad at Northwestern.

Applicantions can be found here.

Student Group Apportionment Committee Applications due Feb. 19th

This application serves as the first step for your student group(s) to obtain a presence in Senate. Each application will be reviewed, interviews will take place and final decisions will be made prior to the first senate of the year.

In order to maximize representation in Senate, the Student Group Apportionment Committee highly encourages groups to apply for a seat together.  For your reference, groups with seats during the 2013-14 school year are listed on the last page.  From there, selected groups will decide independently how best to select a specific individual to represent those groups in Senate.

The deadline to submit applications is February 19th at 6:59pm.

Please submit your application and direct any questions to ASG Chief of Staff at asg-cos@u.northwestern.edu.  Interview times will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Applicantions can be found here. 

Submit Feedback to Campus Voice

Campus Voice is ASG's campus-wide feedback platform that lets students submit ideas, report problems, and ask questions.

Want to give ASG your feedback? Submit to Campus Voice here. 

Build the Next Generation of CTECS

Sign up for focus groups and free pizza next week here. We want to hear your feedback on a new pilot for CTECs.
