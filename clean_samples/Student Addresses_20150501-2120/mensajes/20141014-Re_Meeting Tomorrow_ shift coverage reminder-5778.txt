    Hi NTS

    We're going to have our meeting tomorrow in a location TBD, from 7-8pm - please be on the lookout for an email later detailing the location. If you are a new hire, please come so you can meet the rest of the staff. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason.
     
    In addition, please remember to release all of your shifts that you need covered on shiftplanning by the end of the day. If you have a shift coverage from 10/15 - 10/17 and do not release it on shifplanning, we cannot guarantee that it gets covered at the meeting.  In addition, please make sure to get the shiftplanning app for your phone or bring a laptop, as we will be doing the shift trades during the meeting to reduce confusion.

    Thanks,
