Hi NTS,

We are not going to hold a meeting tomorrow, since everybody's busy studying for finals. If you have any conflicts during finals week or the rest of reading week, just send it out over the listserv.

We are not going to be canceling shifts during finals week, so please make sure you know which shifts you picked up, unless you specifically switched with someone else, the schedule is the same as before.

Happy studying and good luck on your finals,

Alex
