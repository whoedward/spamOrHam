Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a very long, but productive day! We were able to get through the blocking of scenes 2.2 and almost all of 3.1, with almost the entire cast present! It was great.

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    None today!

Costume Notes:

    In the transition during scene 2.2 (when the conspirators enter, after Caesar and Calpurnia’s moment), there will need to be some sort of garment (“robe” in the script) already onstage for Rebecca to give to John.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    If you want to come join us for some fun/bonding/a viewing of a Shakespeare film, come to the Co-op (2000 Sherman Ave) between the hours of 8 and 9 PM!
