Hey everyone, 

Just a reminder, we will be having a MANDATORY all-resident election this Sunday at 8pm in the Main Lounge. We need everyone there in order for the vote to count. If everyone arrives on time, it should take no longer than 10 minutes. There will be food. 

If you absolutely cannot make it, please e-mail me with your excuse ASAP. 

In the interest of being environmentally friendly, this year's resident roster is online: http://bit.ly/Umxy5l Sorry for the delay in getting it up! 

Lastly, a few people have asked me to resend the points list link. Here it is: http://bit.ly/Sxa2BT Points are normally updated within 24 hours; I keep a running tally of updates on the right. Remember, if you are interested in living in ISRC next year, you need to be on at least 3rd list in fall and winter quarters. 

Thanks for reading to the end! As always, feel free to e-mail me with any questions, concerns, etc. 

See you all on Sunday! 

Lots of ISRC love, 
Hannah
