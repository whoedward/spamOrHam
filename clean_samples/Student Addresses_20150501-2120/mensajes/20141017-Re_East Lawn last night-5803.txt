Alex and I were there when the problem occurred.
Both of us were at a loss to understand what happened during the event, and because it happened mid-event, making hardware changes did not seem like an appropriate action.
Our first thought was that it was a problem with the Shure Mixer.  I am not sure, since I was not there for the tear-down.
I've never really seen a problem like this, in which the set up simply cuts out entirely and for seemingly no reason.
