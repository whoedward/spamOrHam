Hi everyone,

Today's meeting was pretty timely, but we covered a lot of ground. Here are the details!

    Elections are happening!
        There are 5 positions:
            2 Co-Chairs - Dictate policy and run meetings
            1 PR chair - Manage social media and event publicity campaigns
            1 Webmaster - Manage the website
            1 Secretary - Take meeting notes
        In order to run, you must be nominated at the next meeting. Other members of the board can nominate you. You can also nominate yourself. OR you can email Jason and I and we will nominate you.
        Regardless, to be eligible, you will need to send us a blurb before the meeting about why you want to run for an MSAB position, and give a short (1-2 minute spiel) about it to the board.
    Clearly we're having scheduling issues. Here is a whenisgood. Please fill it out.

    The McCormick Student Activities Fair is happening!
        Thursday, January 22nd, 10-2 PM
        MSAB is having a booth - let us know if you are free to volunteer any time then.
    Liaisons: Contact your student groups!
        MSAB is piloting a Google Calendar that is to be shared between all McCormick student groups. I need to know what people to give edit permission. Please send an email to your student groups with two requests:
            An email of the person (or persons) who will manage the group's calendar events.
            That they put up all their future events on the calendar.

From,
Michael Wang
