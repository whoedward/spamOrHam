Hi Sandy,

This is Michael, I am one of the supervisors at Norris Tech Services. We received your application applying for the position of A/V Tech, and we'd like to do a brief interview, preferably sometime in this upcoming week. Please let us know what would be some good times and we should be able to work something out.

Have a good day!
