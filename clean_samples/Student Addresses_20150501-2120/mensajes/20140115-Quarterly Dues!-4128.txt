    Hi friends. Dues are going to be $40 again. They're going to be due to me by January 31st (if I don't have your dues by then, you will unfortunately not be allowed to continue practice).

But Joanna, that seems like a lot of money!
    I promise, it's actually a really good deal. If you divide the dues by the number of practices, or even the number of hours we spend practicing, it breaks down really nicely. 

But Joanna, I can't give you $40 at once!
    If you need a form of a payment plan, please send me an email explaining your situation and I will discuss with you a payment plan.

Thanks so much guys

Joanna

PS. Thanks to Rui for paying at the first practice
