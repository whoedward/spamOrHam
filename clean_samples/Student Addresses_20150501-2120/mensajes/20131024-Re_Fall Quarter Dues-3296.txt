Hey, guys,

I also feel it necessary to just say that club dues of $40 per quarter is actually not bad. Considering the fact that we have three practices a week and that there are about ten weeks per quarter, and let's just say that people only come to 2/3 of the practices, that's still just $2 per practice. That is significantly cheaper than the rates that most Tae Kwon Do schools offer. I just wanted to emphasize this.

Also, we understand that we are all still college students who are (for the most part) broke. If you guys have any concerns (i.e, cannot pay the dues but still want to come out, can only come to a limited number of practices, etc.), just let any of the officers know and we can try to figure something out.

Thanks, and I hope you guys understand.

Sincerely,
Davin

    Hey guys, sorry I'm kinda late in sending this out. Dues will be $40 this quarter and I'll begin collecting them this coming week. I'd like to have all of the dues in to me within the next two weeks.

    Thanks!

    Joanna
