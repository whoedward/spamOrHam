        Hey Nathan,

        Sorry about that, I didn't respond in time. Are you free or on shift anytime today (3/3)?

            I would definitely be free to meet during my 10-4 shift tomorrow at Norris, if that would work for you.

            Thank you,

            Nathan

                Hey Nathan,

                Just wondering if you have any available time over the next week or so to sit down for about fifteen minutes with me for a brief discussion.

                Let me know when you are free.

                Regards,
