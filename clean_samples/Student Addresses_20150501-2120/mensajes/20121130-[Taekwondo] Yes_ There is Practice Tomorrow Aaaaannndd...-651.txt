So like the title says, there is practice tomorrow morning. Blomquist at 12. I hope to see you all there, especially if you plan to take the belt test at the end of next week.

Also, if you do plan to test, please reply to this email saying you'd like to test so that I can tell Kallo to bring that many applications Monday.
