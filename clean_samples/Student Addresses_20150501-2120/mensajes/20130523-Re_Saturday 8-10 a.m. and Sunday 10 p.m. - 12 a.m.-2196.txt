    Hey guys,

    Something has come up and I need my Saturday open and Sunday close covered because I am headed out of town this weekend.
    They're both super laid back shifts (I sleep most Saturdays from 8:15 until 10:00) and easy enough.

    If anyone covers these I will owe him/her/them big time.
    Sorry it's so last minute!

    Best,
    Ethan
