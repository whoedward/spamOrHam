Hello NTS,

We're been having some shiftplanning issues lately, so I wanted to reiterate our shiftplanning protocol. See the flowcharts attached for releasing or taking shifts. 

Shiftplanning is our main method of shift communication. Given that, shiftplanning should be your first resource to see what shifts you are on. I change shiftplanning after every meeting for shift changes and filling in rotations/out of house/extra techs. If there is something wrong with your shiftplanning schedule, email me directly (juwonhyun2016@u.northwestern.edu) and I'll change your schedule ASAP. Check shiftplanning frequently and make sure that your shifts are correct. You are responsible for all of your shifts AND FOR MAKING SURE YOUR SHIFTPLANNING IS CORRECT.

Thanks
Will Hyun
