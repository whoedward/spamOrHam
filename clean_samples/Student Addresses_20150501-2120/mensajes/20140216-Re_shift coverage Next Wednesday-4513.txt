I was able to move the meeting time, so I no longer need this shift covered.  Thanks to everyone who responded.

            Hey guys,

            I goofed tonight when I took Tim's 10am-12pm Wednesday shift.  I have a meeting during that time next week, but I can keep it for the rest of the quarter after that.  Could anyone cover this for me next week on the 19th?

            Thanks,

            Will
