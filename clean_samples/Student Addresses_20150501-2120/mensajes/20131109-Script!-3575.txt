Hi everyone!

In case you don't know me yet, I'm the Stage Manager for this wonderful production! I'm so excited to get to work with you all. 

You should all be on the Dropbox, but in case you aren't, or in case you haven't gotten around to checking it lately, I've attached the most recently updated version of the script! It was updated just a few days ago, so please take some time to look at it if you haven't recently--especially if you are a designer or assistant designer and need some reference for our designer meeting on Sunday! And if you for some reason have not been added to the DropBox, please email Matt. 

Additionally, there are still prod team members who have not updated the Contact Sheet with their phone numbers--Matt and I would very much appreciate if you did that ASAP. Just click on the link below.

Thank you, and see you all soon!

Best,
