Hi Ethan,
I'm sorry for the late reply. I was out of town until tonight and my phone hasn't seemed to be working properly.
I have an 8-10 AM and a 4-6 PM shift on Wednesday if you'd like to meet me then.

Let me know when would be most convenient for you.

Best Regards,
Daniela V. DeLeon

    Hi Daniela,

    Just wondering if you have any time over the next week to sit down for about fifteen minutes and talk. It can be while you're on shift or otherwise. Let me know your availability.

    Regards,
