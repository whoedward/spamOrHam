    Hey!

    I have an event that ends around 9 so I could definitely cover you from 9-close if no one else can.

        Hi NTS,

        Is anybody willing to pick up my rotation tonight? I have an essay due tomorrow that is just not coming together right now, and I want to focus completely on it for the rest of the day.

        Thanks,

        Alex
