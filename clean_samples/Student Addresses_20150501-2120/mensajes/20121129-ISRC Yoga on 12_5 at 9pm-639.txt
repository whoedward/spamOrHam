Hello ISRC,

So you already know about some of the great events Exec and RCB have planned during Reading Week to keep you sane and procrastinating; we've got Endless Sushi, Christkindlmarket and Munchies ready to go. Well, because Alec and I are the most concerned Master Staff at NU, we wanted to give you an opportunity to destress and unwind a bit during Reading Week. 

So, I'm very excited to tell you that we've teamed with SPAC to bring you a totally FREE, one hour, all-levels yoga and mediation class right here in the Main Lounge of ISRC. Chelsea, the instructor (who happens to teach at my schmancy yoga studio in Chicago) is an NU Alum (I think trombone performance MA?), and very awesome and friendly. She'll provide mats, props and music; all you guys have to do is show up 5 minutes before 9pm on Wednesday, and get ready to get your Om on! Don't worry if you aren't flexible or if you haven't opened your chakras in awhile; Chelsea's most popular classes are Basics. She might make you laugh at a goofy joke, but she won't put crystals on your forehead. 

If you want to attend the class, just email me so I can reserve a spot for you. There's limited physical space in there, so email me ASAP! And if you guys like the class, we can make this a quarterly thing. Because yoga makes the world a better place. :) 

and P.S. - My Slavic 210 Review is still Tuesday, 12/4 at 7pm for those in Russian Lit! 

Best,
