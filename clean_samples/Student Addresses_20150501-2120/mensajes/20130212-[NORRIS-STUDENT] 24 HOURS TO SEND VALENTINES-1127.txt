Hey Norris! It's almost Valentine's day! Be sure to pick up a valentine (or several) from the board by time clock, fill it out to someone you love, and drop it in the outbox at the info desk by 5pm tomorrow! Some valentine fairies will be coming around to all the departments tomorrow as well to judge who has the cutest valentines mailbox. The best one wins points for their department! So hop to it on those last minute details! The more creative, the better!

SPREAD THE LOVE.

Hugs and kisses,
Meredith
