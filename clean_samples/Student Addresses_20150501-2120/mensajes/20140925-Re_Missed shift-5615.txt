Hi Michael and supers,

I'm so sorry about this. I genuinely was not aware that I was covering this shift so there are no excuses other than I simply forgot. It will never happen again and I will definitely show up for my 6pm shift. In the future, I'll check shift planning more frequently and I am sorry for any inconvenience this caused. 

Best,
Edward Hu

    Edward,
    You were scheduled for the 12-2pm shift today, Thursday as well as the 6-8pm shift.  Please let myself and the Supers know why you missed your shift and if you will be at the 6pm shift.
