Thank you very much, that worked perfectly.

I'll be sure to go to office hours.

Thanks again,
Ethan

    Dipendra has office hours from 4-6pm tomorrow in Wilkinson Lab.  You should go chat with him.

    The error you are seeing is because simpledb is not being built. Go to the directory containing build.xml and run "ant dist".  It will probably make the problem go away.

        My apologies. The last email sent early. I was going to ask if there is anything obvious that I am missing.

        If possible, could I set up an appointment to meet with you or a TA for help on this? I'm having more trouble with the clerical issues than I am with the material.

        Again, thank you for any and all help.

        Best.

            Well, since the repo is reset, I am unsure how to find the commit I did last. I did my last submission on Wednesday (1/28), but I'm not sure if that helps very much.

            Also, I managed to pull the lab 2 files from the remote branch, but Eclipse is now showing a build error:

            Project 'simple-db-hw' is missing required library: 'dist/simpledb.jar'

                Ok, so I am grading lab 1 branch.  Can you point to the commit I should be using to calculate late days?

                    Professor,

                    First of all, thank you so much for helping me out with that.

                    Second, I have more or less cleaned up my repo. I did manage to make a few more mistakes, but they should be sorted out (I hope). Things to note: my lab1 solutions are in the branch labeled, "lab1," and my lab 2 work is in the branch, "lab2;" the master branch has been reverted to a state from before lab 1, and is just kind of sitting there.

                    If this is a problem, or you would like clarification, please let me know.

                    Thanks again for your patience,

                        There were a lot of more fixes needed here:
                        HeapFile.java
                        BufferPool.java
                        HeapPageId.java
                        SeqScan.java
                        HeapPage.java

                        They are checked in to your lab 2 branch. Please review them and make sure you understand what has changed, because you need to build on it later.

                            I am missing the functions readPage() and iterator() from HeapFile, and all of SeqScan.

                            Best,

                                        Ok. I am going to reinitialize your repo.  When I am done, you will have a new lab 2 branch.  So, please back up any work you have done on lab 2.

                                            Thank you very much for your patience. I'm not finished with the lab, but it's a little late to worry about that since Lab 2 is already out. I still need help with some of the exercises from Lab 1 (since Lab 2 depends on them). So, with that in mind, you can grade the attached files. 

                                            Attached are two .zip files: the first one, "homework-soln...," is the download from github of the last useful state of my master branch; the second, "ECR867_lab1_src," is just a copy of all of the src/ files from lab 1. Hopefully one or both of those will have what you need.

                                            I'm so sorry about any confusion, and I'll be much more careful with my repo from now on.

                                            Let me know if there is anything else that you need!

                                            Thanks again,

                                                Just to be clear, should I be grading the one you are sending me?  Or are you still working on it? 

                                                I can't send you solution code until you turn it in.

                                                        I am sorry to say that I know very little about git beyond simple commits and pushes. I tried to revert the master branch, and it didn't work well at all. Should I just create a new branch and micromanage the files to get them to work?

                                                        As far as the parts that I am missing, I need the read() function for HeapFile. I have none of SeqScan done (although I get the feeling that I will be able to to do it on my own once I get HeapFile working; though, I won't decline any help or guidance).

                                                        Let me know what it is that I can do, and I will try to do it as quickly as possible.

                                                            Hi Ethan,

                                                            For HeapFile, that's something we can fix easily, but you need to be more specific about the SeqScan test.  That's one tests your lab end-to-end, so it's hard for me to say what pieces you need to fill in there. 

                                                            I am trying to run your lab now, but for some reason Lab 2 files are appearing in both branches.  You also don't have a tag lab1, so I can't figure out when you intended to hand in your assignment. Did turnInLab.sh have errors when you ran it?
                                                             
                                                            I strongly recommend you roll back your master branch to your last Lab 1 commit, probably 8c82625b3d0726b3731d690c9bddae5bb6d86b4a.  Otherwise, the grader will probably just mark the percentage of tests you pass now, which includes all of the lab 2 tests.  You can do this with "git revert".  Please tell me how to check out your lab 1 submission, and I will help you figure out how to patch it for lab 2.

                                                                Specifically, I had trouble with the HeapFile and SeqScan segments of the first lab, although only with two or three operators in HeapFile.

                                                                With that in mind, what can I do to get up to speed so that I can get started on lab 2 as quickly as possible?
