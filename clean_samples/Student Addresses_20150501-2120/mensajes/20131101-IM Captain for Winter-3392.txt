Hey ISRC,

I am announcing a position opening for next quarter. If you are interested in being IM captain for ISRC, let me know. The sports for next quarter are basketball and floor hockey. As captain you will have to manage rosters, recruit a team, and lead the team to each game. I will be able to help you out with this. Please respond by next Thursday before 4 pm.

Thanks,
Jonas
