HEY GUYS This is Paul Kim your new IM Chair and I am wondering if you could PLEASE fill this out with times that you are available to play. This quarters' sports are BASKETBALL and FLOOR HOCKEY (!!!) and even if you are not proficient in either PLEASE SIGN UP because we need you!! This is a super low key, no pressure deal, except that if you do sign up please remember that we may have to forfeit if you don't show up for the event at that time. I'll be sending out e-mails and the like to remind everyone that signs up of times and the like.

PLEASE FILL THIS OUT BY FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 2014 AT MIDNIGHT (so technically saturday at midnight? or friday 11:59:59 PM)

Thank you SO MUCH
goodbye
