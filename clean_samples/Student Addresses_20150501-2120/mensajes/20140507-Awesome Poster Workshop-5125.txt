Hey guys! Check out this cool workshop on May 21st!

Expo Workshop: Creating Professional Posters and Presenting at an Academic Conference

Creating and presenting a poster for an academic conferences is not a skill you learn in the classroom but is a necessary tool needed to bring your research to the next level. How do you design a poster? What do you put on it? What scenarios should you prepare for while presenting? Don't worry, the Office of Undergraduate Research is here to help!

Whether you are a freshman who wants to get more involved with research, a bio major who wants to impress colleagues at lab meeting, or an upperclassman who will be presenting a senior thesis-- learning how to create and present a professional poster is important for both your time at NU and your academic career. 

This workshop will be hosted in CCI with the Office of Undergraduate Research on May 21st from 7-8pm. Food will be provided. Please email RSVPs to Christie Jeung at christiejeung2017@u.northwestern.edu if you plan to attend.
