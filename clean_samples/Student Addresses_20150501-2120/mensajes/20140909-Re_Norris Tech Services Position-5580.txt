I am hoping to return to NTS this year. Now that I am no longer an RA i got my work study back and I was hoping, since being in NTS was great, that I would be able to return. I will be filling out the application in the next few days. 

Thanks!

    Hi Brett,

    Alex Yang was telling me that you are considering returning to NTS this year. I'm super excited to hear this, and wanted to follow up on that. If you are still thinking about coming back to us, you can find the relevant application on CareerCat.

    If not, best of luck to you!

    Either way, it will be good to hear from you again!

    Best,
