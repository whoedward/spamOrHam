Hey everyone,

I just found out the review session for my econometrics class is scheduled for 3pm on Sunday.
I'm currently scheduled to work a Ryan Event 2-5pm.  I'd really appreciate the chance to attend the review; could anybody cover my portion of the Ryan Event, or at least the 3-5pm portion?  The review session's in Tech LR2, so I'd be able to stay right up until the review starts.

Thanks a bunch,
Ryan
