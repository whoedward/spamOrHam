> Hey everyone,

> Do you want to host prospective students? Well today is your lucky day!  We are the Student Admission Council, and we work with the admission office to do a lot of on campus assistance of interested students. What does this mean? You can host prospective students, go to lunch or dinner with a potential applicant, be an ambassador to your high school, or even just be the cool college students that all the high school seniors look up to! 
>
> If this sounds interesting at all, please sign up to volunteer for the Student Admission Council! We are in particular need of people who want to host prospective students overnight.

> If you want to get invovled, the first thing that you want to do is fill out this form:

> This will put you on the Student Admission Council Listserv. From there, we send out an email every week asking for people to host prospective students. If you want to host one that week, you would just reply to our email, and we will try to set up an overnight visit with you! We will also send out requests asking for volunteers for different events later in the year.
