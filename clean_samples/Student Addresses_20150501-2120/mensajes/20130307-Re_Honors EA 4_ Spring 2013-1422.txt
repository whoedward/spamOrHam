    Hi Ethan,

    I have placed you on my list of students that need to be put into EA.  The process of placing each student takes several weeks so I will register you in your section over spring break.

    Hello Heather

     

    Thanks for your assistance.

    However, due to a conflict with my organic chemistry lab, I also need a schedule change that allows me to take EA 3 at 12:00. This class is full, unfortunately. If it is possible, could you please assist me with this?

     

    Thanks,

    Ethan Robison
