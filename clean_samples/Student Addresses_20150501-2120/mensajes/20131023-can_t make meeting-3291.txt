Hey! Sorry I just realized my email from last night was never sent out. :( I have to meet up with my bio lab group to finish our group lab notebook today. Since it's midterm week people were pretty busy and this time worked best for the rest of the people in my group. It's a one time thing! 

Thanks, 
Angela
