Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I realize I wasn't entirely clear in my previous email about the people auction.  Quick summary: the people auction is a DM fundraiser in which you can donate anything you want and ISRCers and non-ISRCers alike can bid online for a week or so.  You bid on Facebook by commenting on photos in the album "2014 Auction Listings", which is part of the ISRC People Auction group. https://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction

Examples of what you can donate: cooking a meal for someone, teaching someone how to cook a certain dish, giving fashion advice, pulling a prank on someone, grocery shopping, baking, language lessons, music lessons, massages, DVDs on loan, manicures, photo shoots, website design, paper editing, technological support, etc. For more ideas, look through the 2013 and 2014 Auction Listing albums.

If you want to donate something to the People Auction, email, text, or FB me by this Saturday, 2/8, at 11:59pm.

You can start bidding on the 2014 listings now, but you may want to wait until all the listings are up on Sunday.  

Tag the ISRC People Auction in a status on Facebook so more people participate and we raise more money!!!

The online bidding will probably last until ID (Sunday, Feb. 3), but I'll send out an email with more info later.

Thanks, and much ISRC-love,
Ayla
