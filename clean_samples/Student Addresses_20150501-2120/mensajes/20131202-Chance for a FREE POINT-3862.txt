Hey everyone,

In case you weren't at open exec last night, you have the chance to earn a point that counts for any category you want. On my door outside room 304, there are blank surveys on the left of my door. Fill it out with your name and point category you want your point in, and place completed surveys on the clip on the right side of my door (or slide them under my door, up to you).

Thanks!
Thomas
