Today is the last day of Spirit Week! Today we're going for Northwestern spirit, so pile on all your purple today, before trading it out for your thrift shop formalwear at Norris Prom tonight! This is your last chance to win points in the department house cup!

Also, here are yesterday's nerd day winners: Harlynn Siler from Housestaff and Cynthia Beltran from Tech Services! Honorable mentions go to Smart Dillo, for being amazing at rubik's cubes, and Isabelle Orrico, for being the saddest nerd. Nice work! Their photos are all attached.

Can't wait to see you tonight! Good friends, good music, and good food (did someone say mac n cheese cups?) await! There will be more opportunities for prizes at the Prom, so don't hold back on your costume! See you in Big Ten at 8!

With greatest excitement and anticipation of the moment we've been waiting for all year long,
