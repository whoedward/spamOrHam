Hey NTS,

An extra event got added tomorrow (Tuesday, 2/24).  It is at the Great Room and is only a laptop, projector, and screen.  

It is just a delivery.  We need:

Setup: leave Norris 4PM, event starts at 5.  You can leave once the client is comfortable.

Cleanup: event ends at 7, res ends at 7:30.  Clean up everything and take back to Norris.

Please reply ASAP if you can help!  Sorry about the late notice but please respond if you can work.

Best,
Christina
