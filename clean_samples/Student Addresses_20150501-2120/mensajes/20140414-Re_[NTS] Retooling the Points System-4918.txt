I'm in favor, but as it stands, the 3-point system hasn't necessarily been followed anyway. We've sent emails to people before but it doesn't seem like we've really tracked small infractions. 

I would say we wouldn't want to actually introduce this to the full staff until next year for the sake of avoiding confusion. Once it is in effect though, we should enforce it strictly. It makes way more sense to have 5 points!

    Supes,

    I think that we should change the points system. We currently have a 3 point system (1 - warning, 2 - sit down, 3 - termination), but I've never seen anyone get a second point, because a sit down after two mistakes is kind of unnecessary.

    I propose we move to a 5 points system:
    Points 1-4: Strikes
    Point 5: Sit down w/ a super and/or Michael
    Afterwards, it will depend but if it's serious enough, then it can be termination.

    This way, we can enforce rules more consistently. We can give points for not initialing the sheets, for example, while in the old system it would just be too harsh.

    1 Strike Penalty:

        Showing up more than 15 minutes late
        Not initialing the sheets
        Not doing set-ups/clean-ups or sweeps
        Not wearing a Norris t-shirt

    Let me know what you think
