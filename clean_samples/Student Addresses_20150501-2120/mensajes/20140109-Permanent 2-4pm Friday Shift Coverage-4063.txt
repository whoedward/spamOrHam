Hey,

So looks like I spoke too soon when I said my work schedule was perfect.  I just found out I've got a discussion section (which was NOT indicated on Caesar) at 3pm on Fridays.

Would anybody be able to take my 2-4pm Friday shift permanently?  I don't need it covered this week, thankfully, but starting next week I will.

If it should fit into my schedule, I'd be willing to trade for an unwanted shift.

Many thanks,
Ryan
