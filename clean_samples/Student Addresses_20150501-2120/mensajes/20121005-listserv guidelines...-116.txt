Hey All!

Sorry to be the one with the cranky news... but we've instituted a new policy this year for the Northwestern Triathlon listserv.  

As you know, the beginning of the year means get ONE THOUSAND emails from every single club on campus.  We don't want to be one of those clubs. 

So, we've created other avenues for people to spread their news! 
1. Facebook page!  Facebook is a great tool - feel free to post things (triathlon-related) on it.  If you want to get people together for runs, bikes, swims, yoga, etc. use that as your means for doing so.
2. The Weekly Tri!  If you have big announcements or things you want to share with the team (fun recipes, announcements, race reports, information about upcoming races, etc) send them along to me and I'll determine whether or not it's fit for the TWT :)  I'm not terribly snotty about it and I'm always looking for material, so most likely if you send something, it'll be included in the next TWT.
The TWT is updated every Sunday and I encourage you all to read it.

Thanks guys!  We are doing this for the sanity of everyone on the team.  On the Exec board end, we are doing everything we can to send out as little emails as possible so that we don't overwhelm you guys and so you actually pay attention to the emails that do get sent out.  Make sense?

Sorry again to be a brat, but we need to crack down harder this year than we have in the past because the club has gotten so huge.

Please feel free, always, to email any of us with questions, comments, concerns, etc.

See you all tomorrow night at Rich's house!  2021 Ridge Ave. @ 9:30pm :)

tri love,
Anna B
