Hello all,

As we head into our final week before tech week, I wanted to thank you for all of your hard work thus far. We still have a lot more to do and a long two weeks ahead of us, but I just wanted to let y'all know how much I admire each and every one of you. 

I had the pleasure of watching a full stumble-through of the show yesterday and I was BLOWN AWAY. The cast and rehearsal team has crafted a witty, hilarious, tragic and incredibly smart show, proving with gusto that Shakespeare's words are still bursting with relevance. 

To the designers and the entire prod team: I can't thank you enough for all of the time and hard work thus far. Your expertise and initiative is inspiring, and I am so grateful for your support and commitment. Y'all are BRILLIANT and you should know that.

Keep up the great work everyone. I am so impressed and I can't wait to share all of your amazing work in two weeks. As always, if you ever have any questions or concerns I am here for you. Never hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email; I am always happy to talk or give advice or just listen. 

Final note: if you want to come and watch rehearsal at any point this week, text or email Alina! 

Peace,
Matt
