Hello everyone!

As a fundraiser for the club, we're planning on working the concessions for the Ohio State homecoming game on Saturday.  This will help offset costs for people to take part in the club (dues, testing, tournaments).

If you are interested in helping out, please send me your name by 3:30 today.  Sorry for the short notice, we kind of had to scramble to get this together.

Check in starts at 3:30PM on Saturday, Oct 5th before the game.  You would be required to be there at that time to receive your shirts and training.  The shifts go until 10PM.  I imagine you wouldn't have to be there the entire time depending on how many people help out.

So again, if you're interested in helping out, please send me your name ASAP!

Allan
