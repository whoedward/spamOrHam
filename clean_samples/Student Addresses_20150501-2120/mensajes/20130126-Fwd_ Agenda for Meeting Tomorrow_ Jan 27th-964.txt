I thought I sent this to you too even though I didn't so I need to check my e-mail settings

Also, Jonas suggested we meet at 2:30 instead of staying until 4:30, and I agree with him. What do you think?

Would it be possible to meet for an hour and a half tomorrow instead of just an hour? To be honest, I don't want to either, but looking at the syllabus it seems like spending a little extra time right now will save us a lot of stress/mistakes in the future. The extra time will be occupied by discussions about designs and project goals/deadlines, which I think we need to seriously discuss tomorrow, not next week. 

Here's the agenda for tomorrow

DTC Meeting Agenda

27th of January, 2013

by William Krinsman

-Get Update about Results of User Observation (10 minutes)

-Briefly Discuss Individual Writing Assignment so everyone is on Same page (5 min)

-Briefly Review Individual Reading/Lecture Watching Assignments so we all pass quiz (5 min)

-Make a Gantt Chart for Long-Term Organization (10 min)

-Brainstorm more OR choose/focus on 3 design alternatives for mockups (30 min)

- Make a RAM Chart to Delegate Tasks for at least Next Two Weeks (30 min)

    During next meetings then we will have to spend less time assigning tasks and spend more time giving updates.
    Tasks to be delegated:
        1st draft Projection Definition (Appendix G) - Due 4.1
        Alternatives Matrix - Due 4.2
        Mock-up Sheets (for at least 3 different alternatives) - Due 4.2
        Early mockups (if appropriate) - Due 4.2
        This RAM chart itself - Due 4.2
        User Testing/Performance Guides - Week 5 & 6
        Further Work on Mockups - Week 5 & 6
    Note 1 : We will have to do most of the filling in of the details ourselves for weeks 5 & 6; syllabus starts becoming sparse at that point
    Note 2 : We should try and get as much early work done as possible in regards to the mockups, for the following reasons
        We will build a better quality product and get a better grade
        We will have more time at the end of the quarter to test/improve our design
        The shop apparently becomes very crowded at the end of the quarter (2 hour long lines for machines), so any work saved for then would be highly inefficient
        Save ourselves unnecessary end of quarter stress by avoiding DTC distracting us from studying for the finals for our other classes
