Hey everyone!

Next week Tuesday, March 10th at 6pm we will be heading to Thai Sookdee for a dinner with the fellows! There are 10 spots available, and the dinner will be completely paid for by ISRC.

I will send out an email tomorrow at 1pm, so respond to that email to secure a spot!

Thanks,
Coretta
