Hey Ethan,
       That was my bad. I got really busy during that shift with the issues in McCormick and setting up two rooms so I prioritized setting up the rooms to turning it off. I'll look out for that in the future.

Thanks,
Will

Additionally, the sheets have no signature down for clean-up. Please make sure to check rooms periodically throughout your shifts, and please be aware that, if something happens on a shift and no one signs the sheets, both of you will be held accountable for issues.
