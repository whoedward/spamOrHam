Dear Michael,

I am really sorry for this morning, it was totally my fault and I will be more diligent with my schedule in the future. Also, I would just want to thank Max that despite being late, he did not miss his shift and had to do the job for the both of us. If possible, can you reconsider Max's warning since he did not miss the entire shift and I feel like the incident this morning was my sole responsibility and would accept any disciplinary actions for it. Once again, I'm really sorry for the this morning and will try really hard to make sure that this doesn't happen in the future. 

Sincerely,

Sandy Cheung

    The two of you were scheduled to work the Thursday open, but showed up late (or not at all). What happened?

    You guys are experienced techs, and missing a shift is kind of a big deal, so unless something serious prevented you from showing up, we're going to have to give the both of you a formal warning. Let me know if you have any questions.

    From,
    Michael Wang
