Howdy everyone,
Just letting everyone know that I'll be in the basement of Patten tonight starting at 7:30 running a review / training / conditioning session to anyone interested. I'm still hammering a set weekly time, but for today, 7:30 pm at Patten.
Come down to learn, train. Bring friends if you want to.
Just a heads up, this is both a boxing and muay thai session, so extra fun.
Sean Bowen-Williams
