Just realized that Jolo sent this along. We should expect him and Nelson back after the Thanksgiving break though.

Hello supervisors,

ReFusionShaka is coming up in approximately one month and full on practice schedules are getting started. I have practice conflicts during the meeting times so I will be unable to make anymore meetings through the week of Thanksgiving. I'll keep an eye on the meeting notes for shift coverages and whatnot. 

Thanks!
 - Jolo
