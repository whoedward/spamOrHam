Hello NTS!

I hope you all had a wonderful (and safe) Dillo Day.  I, myself, am the color of a lobster currently, but it was all worth it.  

This is a reminder that at our final meeting this Wednesday, we will be doing all shift coverages through the end of the year, including finals week.  You must get everything covered at the meeting.  If you try to do it on Shiftplanning on your own after the meeting, we cannot guarantee it will get covered.  To increase efficiency, please email all the shift coverages you need to ntssupervisors@gmail.com.  Last quarter we just made a big list on a Word Doc and it went very quickly.

Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your weekend.
Christina
