We will make those announcements at the meeting and get that 3/28 event covered.  Thanks for sending everything along!

Best,
Christina

    NTS Supervisors,

    I have attached the updated AV Board and 2 week report.  If you can assist me in filling the event on 3/28 in advance, I’d appreciate it.  Shift has been posted to ShiftPlanning.  Other shifts for spring break have also been posted.  I know Phoebe has already signed up for a few.

     

    A few things to mention at tonight’s meeting.

    1.       We have added wall controls in Scholars, so a remote control will no longer be needed.  Please tell everyone to take a look, and let me know if you have any questions.

    2.       The back room in the Lab has been cleaned out.  It will be “closed” for cleaning/reorganization for the next week.

    3.       I will be hiring 2 new supers to join your team.  This is in response to your suggestions to have an overlap.  I’ll send out an email when the positions have been posted to career cat.

    4.       As techs are beginning to run out of hours, I will be hiring a few techs to join our team.  Please tell everyone to pass that on to friends looking for on campus jobs.

     

    Thanks!
