Hey everyone,

Wednesday will be the last practice of the quarter. You can give me your testing applications then or you can give them to me on Saturday along with the testing fee at the belt test.

The test is this Saturday, 11 AM in Patten Gymnasium, so be there by around 10:40 to have time to get in uniform and stretch out a little. DON'T show up at Blomquist Gym because yeah, it's not there. Again, that's Patten Gym. The one waaaaaay up north.

Alright. See you all at the last practice of the quarter and good luck to all our testers!

Ji-hoon
