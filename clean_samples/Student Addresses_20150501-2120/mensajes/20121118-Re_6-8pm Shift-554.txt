    Hey all,

    I know this is really short-notice, and if nobody can take it I'll manage, but would it be possible for anyone to cover my 6-8 shift today?  It seems in my post-midterms haze I promised a few too many people to help with a few too many projects.

    Thanks for the help,

    Ryan
