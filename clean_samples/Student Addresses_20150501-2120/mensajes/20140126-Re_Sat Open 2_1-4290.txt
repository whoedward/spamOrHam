I'm already on shift, or I would.

Best,

    Hello friends,
     
    I am leaving for Atlanta on Saturday at around 4AM and will not be here for the shift. I know it is early but I would really appreciate it if someone could cover this shift for me.
     
    I have also released this shift on shiftplanning
     
    Thanks!
    Max
