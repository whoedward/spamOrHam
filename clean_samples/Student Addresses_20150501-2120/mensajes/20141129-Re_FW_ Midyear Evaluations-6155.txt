BUMP.  Don't forget to sign up for who you want to evaluate before December 2nd.  Only Will and I have done it so far.

    Please pick three employees you feel comfortable evaluating.  Two of you may need to pick four depending on our numbers right now.  Just like last year, I will perform your Supervisor evaluation and show you how to go over the form with your employees.  Let’s make sure everyone participates in a timely manner this year, to knock out the process ASAP.

     

    Thanks,

    Good evening,

     

    You are receiving this email because you are listed as a supervisor of Norris student staff.  The Norris Student Employment Committee is preparing the Midyear Evaluations for distribution in the next several days.  As was the case last year, we are working with Campus Labs to make the student self-assessment and the supervisor evaluation, each online surveys.  We will need your assistance now and in the coming weeks. 

     

    We have created a Google Doc, listing student employees by area, for your review.  Should there be any errors or omissions, please reply to this email.

    Since the evaluations will essentially be two individual surveys per student employee, we will also need to know the name of the supervisor who will be evaluating each student.  For smaller areas, the full-time staff supervisor will likely be the evaluator.  For larger areas, where it would be impractical for the full-time staff supervisor to evaluate all of their employees, student supervisors may be designated to evaluate some student staffers.  Evaluation assignments will be ultimately decided by the full-time staff supervisor of each area.  So please work with your staff supervisor to complete the Google Doc.

     

    When assigning evaluators to students on the Google Doc form, please keep the following in mind:

    1.  Evaluators/designees must have at least two student employees that they are evaluating

    2.  Because student/evaluator assignments are hard-coded in the online form, assignments cannot be changed

    3.  Student designees should be student supervisors or have some supervisory responsibilities.

    4.  The student supervisor should be familiar with the work of the student they are evaluating

    5.  Designees should not be both student and evaluator on their own performance

     

    If you have any questions about this process, please reply to norrisemployment@u.northwestern.edu as soon as possible. The deadline to enter evaluation assignments is 3:00pm on Tuesday, December 2nd.

     

    Regards,

     

    Norris Student Employment Committee
