Performance Notes:

    The show happened. It went awesome.
    The audience was pretty small, so the energy was a little low, but the actors did not seem to be affected at all! It went very smoothly, and everything felt like it was in a great place.

Scenery Notes:

    Someone accidentally stepped on a part of the lowest platform’s paper mache during the fight call. It’s not that noticeable, but I’m just letting you know in case you want to fix it.
    Otherwise everything worked great, thank you!

Prop Notes:

    Maia gave Grace a piece of money (literally just a dollar bill) because we never got anything for that one scene.
    Otherwise everything was fine! Thank you!

Costume Notes:

    Everything looked great!

Light Notes:

    One of the lights that you fixed for risk management needs to be adjusted. Maia says you know about this. If you need to run cues tomorrow, let me know and I could come to the space in the later afternoon/early evening to help.

Sound Notes:

    It worked. Yay! Thank you!

Blood Notes:

    Looked awesome, thank you!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Everything was great, thank you so much!
