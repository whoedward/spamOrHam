Hey guys,

Just a reminder there is practice tomorrow at 11 at blomquist.  We will be covering some of the techniques we covered last week as well as expanding our moves sets from the guard position.  These will include guard passing and some other essential submissions like the armbar and triangle.  Here is a video combining some of the techniques we will be discussing.
