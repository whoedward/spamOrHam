Class,

Thank you all for being awesome students this quarter. I hope that you learned a lot, and moreover I hope that I helped you all get to where you wanted to be.

Our discussion sections were my first experience lecturing in front of a classroom and I'm sure my inexperience showed. But I do hope to get much better at it, and perhaps in many years I will look back to the last few months as a starting point of sorts. Thanks for being patient participants.

Have a good spring break, everyone!

Karna
