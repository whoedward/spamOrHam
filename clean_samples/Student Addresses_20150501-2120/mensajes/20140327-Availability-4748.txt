Hi Barbara,

I hope that this finds you well. I have my schedule arranged for the quarter, and therefore know my availability. I also took a look at the Metra schedule and have figured out a couple of optimal slots.

Here are the ones that work best (I tried to make them all about 3 hours. but we could do longer or shorter):

Mondays 1:15 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Tuesdays 9:15 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Fridays  1:15 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Saturdays 11:15 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Sunday 11:15 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

If none of these work for you, I can rearrange my work schedule (it's not yet finalized) to open up Thursday morning.

Let me know what you think, and if there is anything other information that I can give to you.

Best,

--
