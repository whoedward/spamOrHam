Hey Best Fairchildren, 

Sorry to announce a last minute change of the movie as I have got problems in getting a DVD of "Lagaan". Still, we are going to watch a Bollywood blockbuster  "Three Idiots". It is a great Hindi comedy about three college students. Also, don't forget to come Academic and Fellow Committee Meeting at 8PM in the main lounge. See you all there.

Best,
Arkar
