Hello supervisors,

ReFusionShaka is coming up in approximately one month and full on practice schedules are getting started. I have practice conflicts during the meeting times so I will be unable to make anymore meetings through the week of Thanksgiving. I'll keep an eye on the meeting notes for shift coverages and whatnot. 

Thanks!
 - Jolo
