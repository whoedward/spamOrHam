Hi EA1 Students,
I received a request from our graders to change the naming convention for the programming assignments. Instead of naming your file "homework#.m" (e.g. homework2.m), please name it "hw#_netid.m" (e.g. hw2_ivm633.m). This will help the graders by creating a unique name for each submission. The submission guidelines on Blackboard have also been changed to reflect this. If you've already submitted your second assignment, you don't have to change anything, but please make this change for future assignments.
