    Ethan,

    I saw that you have questions on problems 34, 42, and 44 from section 14.3. I graded your assignment as-is, but I want to make sure you know that you can submit answers for these problems by Friday and I'll give you 50% credit for them.

    I'll be discussing how to do one of the problems in discussion on Thursday and you can come in to my office hours later that day (1-3pm) to discuss the others.

    -Karna
