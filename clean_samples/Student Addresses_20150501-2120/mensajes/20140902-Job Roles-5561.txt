Supes,

I know we talked about job roles last summer and I thought they were a really good idea. I think we should try to formalize a list of these. So far I have:

    Hiring and Resume Review
    ShiftPlanning and Time Conflict Resolution
    Lab Maintenance/Trash Duty
    Discipline

I feel like if we rotate these among the supers on a weekly basis, it will increase our job awareness and prevent burnout. If anyone has extra categories they can think of, let me know, otherwise I will try to create a rotating board.
