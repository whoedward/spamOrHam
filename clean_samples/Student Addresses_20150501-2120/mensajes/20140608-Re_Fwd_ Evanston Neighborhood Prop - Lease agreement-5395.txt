    Ethan, it was a pleasure to meet all the guys yesterday and I know you guys are going to have a blast in your apartment. We are so glad Mike has found a great group of friends. Mark and I will be able to supply many items so can you send the list you have now so that if we see items in shops or garage sales, we won't over buy? I also do not have the lease attachment on the email you sent me. My email keeps being updated but I still don't see it. Would you please resend.
    Thanks and good luck with finals this week.
     
    Mary McCauley

    Hi Mary,

    Sorry for the delayed response. Mike and I can make it into your office with the relevant information and fees on Monday, February 10th (2/10/14). We should be there in the afternoon. If that time does not work for you, or if you have any questions, please let me know what I can do to help.

    Best,
    Ethan Robison

        Thank you for the business.
         
        Please find attached the lease agreement and tenant ordinance.
         
        At this time we ask that you sign off on the lease and pay the first months rent.
         
        Our office is located at 1316 Chicago ave and if you can stop by within the week, I would really appreciate it.
         
        Please let us know if any questions come up.
