Will,

Thanks for letting me know about all of that. Just so that you know, the LED spotlights are controlled by a panel to the right of the mixer (on the table). Bringing slider number 5 all the way up and then all the way down will turn off the LED spotlights. Again, a returning tech should be able to help you out with this. If neither of you can figure it out, feel free to call any of the supers for assistance.

Regards,
Ethan

    Hey Ethan,
            Just wanted to let you know that John was the one who put away both of the walkies in the hollow at the end of the night, and I put my A/V bag back in the lab. As for the lights in McCormick, John and I were in the booth together, and I'm sure we hit All Off on the light switches in the booth, so I guess the spots are part of that switch. I don't know what the LEDs are in McCormick yet, but I'll be sure to make sure they're turned off tonight, if you let me know what they are. 

    Thanks, 
    Will

        Hey Will,

        I'm emailing you regarding your closing shift last night (10/18/13). In particular, the LEDs (spots) in McCormick were left on, an A/V bag was left in the Hollow, and one of the walkies was not seated in its cradle properly.
        This email serves to remind you of the importance of general upkeep as a part of your job in Tech Services. If you ever need any help doing anything, don't hesitate to contact any of the Supers or returning techs, all of whom are glad to help wherever they can.

        If this information is inaccurate, or if you have any questions, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com right away.

        Regards,
        Ethan Robison
