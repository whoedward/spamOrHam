I forgot to fill out my availability... Sorry. My schedule was actually in limbo moment because I am still on a waitlist for some classes. Anyways, I have some shifts that I can't take, so I would like to know if any of the supes want to trade for the following, before I send it out to the general listserv:

Monday 12-2 PM
Thursday 12-2 PM
Friday 2-4 PM

I'm pretty flexible with scheduling.

From,
Michael Wang
