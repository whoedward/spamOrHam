Hello Ali,

I am a student in Russ Joseph's 11am 203 class. I was unable to attend lecture this morning and as such did not have a chance to submit the homework. I was not sure where I could take the submission, so I am attaching a scan of my work.

Hopefully this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, and thanks in advance for you time. Also, where is the office, so that I can find it in the future?

Thank you so much, and please let me know if you need anything else from me.

Best,
Ethan Robison
