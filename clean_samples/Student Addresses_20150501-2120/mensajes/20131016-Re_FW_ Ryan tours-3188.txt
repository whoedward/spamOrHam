    Michael,

     

    I have schedule several blocks in Ryan this week to take my staff over and give them tours.  If any of your Tech Supervisors were available to come over and join us and help show us around/talk to us about working Ryan, that would be fantastic.  We will leave Cahn and walk over at the top of the hours listed below, so we will probably get there around :15 after.  We are going to do the tours regardless, but send this out to your supers and see if any of them can join in.

     

    Today, 10/15: 3p-4p

    Weds, 10/16: 1p-2p

    Thurs, 10/17: 4p-5p

    Fri, 10/18: 4p-5p

     

    Thanks!
