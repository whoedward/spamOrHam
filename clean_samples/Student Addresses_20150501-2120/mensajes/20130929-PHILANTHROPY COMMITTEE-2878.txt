Hello, lovely ISRCers!!

Thanks to everyone who has already emailed me to express interest in joining the low-stress Philanthropy Committee! If you want to join and haven't emailed me yet, what are you waiting for?! Also, if you're not sure if you want to join, email me anyway so I can make you feel super guilty and force you to join! Jk, I wouldn't do that, I just want to know if you're thinking about it. :) And come to open exec tonight! You'll hear me talk about an awesome volunteer opportunity where you can put makeup on teens who will be dressing up as zombies for the EPL (Evanston Public Library) Zombie Walk on Friday, October 25!

ISRClove,
Ayla
