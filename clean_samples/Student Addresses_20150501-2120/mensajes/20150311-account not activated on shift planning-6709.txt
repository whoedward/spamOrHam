Hi Supers, 

I just realized that my account on shift planning isn’t activated for some reason. It was working fine last quarter! (I haven’t checked it in a while lol) I couldn’t release my shift for next week on shift planning so I thought I’d email you guys. I won’t be able to make my 6- midnight shift 3/17 wednesday  I’ll be in california by then. See you guys at the meeting today!

Best, 

Angela
