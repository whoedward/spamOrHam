Hello Michael,

I'm not sure to whom I should go to speak about this, but I do know where it is that I will be living next year, and that I need to provide this information to someone so that early housing can be arranged.

Is there any information that you can offer me in terms of where I should go? I just need to provide my room number, as my dorm and other information should be in the system already.

If I can provide you with any other information, please let me know.

Best,
Ethan Robison
