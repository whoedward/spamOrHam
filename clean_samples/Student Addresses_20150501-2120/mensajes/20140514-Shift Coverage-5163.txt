Hello, 

I am on shift during the meeting tonight and I might need to be sitting in the McCormick booth so I don't know how present I'll be for the meeting itself. 

KASA has just recently confirmed it's bookings for rehearsals for the upcoming KASA Show and I need to be there from 6-8pm tomorrow. That is also my shift time so I need that shift covered. I cannot miss this last dress rehearsal. Sorry for the late notice but the times were just confirmed today.

Thanks guys! Hopefully I can be at the meeting to trade shifts if needed.
