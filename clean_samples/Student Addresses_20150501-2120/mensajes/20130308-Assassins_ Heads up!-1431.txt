Hey y'all,

Congratulations, you're still in the game! Trust me, that's a bigger accomplishment than you'd think. 

I am participating in Dance Marathon, so I will not be replying e-mail until Sunday afternoon. Please continue to report kills to me so that I can keep track - but you won't be hearing back from me right away. 

However, if a conflict arises (that affects game play), feel free to text me: 224-545-6769. I promise to reply within 3 hours. That being said, I do not have the game roster memorized, so remember to ask for your new target after a kill. 

Have fun. :) 

Hannah
