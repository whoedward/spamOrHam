An Evening With Shmoop
Where: L251
When: Wednesday, Oct. 15 at 5PM

Weâ€™ll show your brain a good time.

So what do we have planned out for this date?

    An introduction to Shmoop (but for foodies)
    A short talk (like a Medium post, but live)
    A coding challenge (like a hackathon, but shorter and not really a hackathon!)

Oh, and did we mention food?
