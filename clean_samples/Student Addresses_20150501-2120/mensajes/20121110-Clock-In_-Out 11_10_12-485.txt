Hello Michael,

Sorry to bother you again, but at the end of tonight's shift (5:51p.m.-12:15a.m.), I was unable to clock out. I'm assuming that the system assumes that I have failed to punch out if I have not done so by close. If this is not the case, then I am not sure what happened. Regardless, I was on shift at those times. I apologize for any inconvenience this might be to you.

Thanks again,

Ethan Robison
