    Ethan,

    Thank you for alerting me. This is steeling from the university, as well as from the federal work study program, and I take that very seriously. And it also effects us all when this person runs out of hours prematurely.

     

    I ask that you all help me keep an eye on this moving forward. I'll keep a close eye on time sheets.

        Hey Chris,

        One of the techs (who has asked to remain anonymous) told me the other morning (3/12) that she saw another tech swipe out of a shift that he wasn't working. When she asked him why he was doing that, he laughed and said that he had forgotten to swipe out of his morning shift.

        The tech asked to not get him in trouble for this particular act (since he might blame her), but suggested that we keep an eye on people with unusually long hours. I have an idea who the tech might be, but I don't want to jump to any conclusions.

        With that in mind, we'll try to keep an eye on techs on our end. Please let us know if we need to do or say anything. I know that wage topics can be tricky.

        Best,

        Ethan
