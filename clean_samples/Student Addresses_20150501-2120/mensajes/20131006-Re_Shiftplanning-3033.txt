My bad, I probably didn't look at the correct times, you're still on that shift.

    Hey Guys,

    I'm not sure who filled out the stuff for shiftplanning today but on shiftplanning it says that Max is working my 2pm-4pm tomorrow. I didn't trade shifts with him and it still says that I'm working that shift on the meeting notes from Thursday, so just wondering if that was changed on purpose or if I should still work that shift. Thanks!
