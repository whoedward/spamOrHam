    So we had to convert the t-shirt design to illustrator and this is what the final image looks like- let me know if your good with it or we need to make tweeks.

    Michael,

    My designer changed up the font. Let me know if this works or if you'd like to use something different. 

    Thanks,

    James

    Thanks so much!  Since we plan on doing this every year- is there a way for us to get a copy of Illustrator- free copy that is?

    We'll see what we can do to recreate it. Give my staff a couple of days and we'll create a vector-based design.

    Any suggestions- or should I just pay ACUI to recreate the file?

    Unfortunately none of the programs we have will open Publisher files.

    Hey James,

    Is there a way your staff can change this publisher file into Adobe Illustrator?  We would like to avoid the additional charges of having ACUI procurement create the file.  I have attached the publisher file.

     

    Thanks,

     

    Michael
