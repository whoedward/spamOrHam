[Please forward to your listservs ASAP]

RCB has been working with DM to put on a special, res college-exclusive trivia night! This is a great way to get your fellows and master staff more involved in Dance Marathon.

Like other DM trivia nights, it will take place at Buffalo Wild Wings, and there is a suggested $5 donation. But there are two twists that make this trivia night more fun:

1) Only teams representing res colleges will be allowed to participate
2) Every team must have at least one fellow/master staff!

Think of it as a warm up for RCB Quiz Bowl, which will be happening in early February! If you have any questions, please ask your RC's academic chair. So to summarize...

RCB DM Trivia Night!
Thursday, January 16 @ 6:00pm
Buffalo Wild Wings
$5 Donation to DM
Every team must have a fellow or master!
