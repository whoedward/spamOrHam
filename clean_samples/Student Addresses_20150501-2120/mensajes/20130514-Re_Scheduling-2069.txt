Professor,
 
Thank you very much. I will have to contact Dr, You to see if he is available.
 
Thanks,
Ethan

    Dear Ethan, 

    Advising week was last week, and Prof. You had a doodle poll to schedule his meetings.  I know that Prof. You is out of town right now, but he should be back later this week.  If you aren't able to get an appointment with him, let me know by Thursday.  I do have a small amount of time on Thursday afternoon or Friday that I could meet with you.  

    Best regards, 

    Prof. Cole

        Hello Jennifer,

        My name is Ethan Robison, and I am a freshman in McCormick. Unfortunately, there has been a snafu with meeting with my scheduling advisor. I have not been able to contact him regarding my fall quarter schedule. My advisor is Fengqi You, and given the proximate opening of registration, I would like to meet with an advisor as soon as possible.

        Do you have any advice regarding this situation? If there is any information that I can provide to you, please let me know. Additionally, if I should contact anyone besides you (I have already emailed Professor You), please let me know as well.

        Thank you for your patience.

        Best,
        Ethan Robison
