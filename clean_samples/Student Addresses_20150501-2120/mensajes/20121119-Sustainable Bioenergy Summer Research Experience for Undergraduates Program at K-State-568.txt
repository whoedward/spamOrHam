If you would like a challenging and fun summer research experience in Sustainable Bioenergy please see the message below and the attached file.  We have openings in Agriculture Economics, Agronomy, Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Grain Science and Industry, and Sociology.

 

Kansas State University is now accepting applications for the Summer 2013 Research Experience for Undergraduates program May 28, 2012 – August 2, 2013.  The application deadline is February 15, 2013.

 

The Kansas State University Center for Sustainable Energy seeks applications for its summer 2013 REU program in sustainable bioenergy funded by the National Science Foundation. Total value of this program is $7,600.00 per student.

 

Eligibility: We accept students from all science, agricultural, and engineering majors and class years. Applicants must be American citizens or permanent residents. First-generation college students, members of ethnic minority groups, females in STEM disciplines, and other under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. No previous laboratory or research experience is required.

 

Program Overview: The research you will receive in this program under the guidance of faculty mentors will advance your state of knowledge in sustainable energy. You will participate in “hands-on” experiences with processing agricultural biomass, experiencing the physical environment of industrial-scale biomass processing with all its limitations and opportunities. Students will also meet people that actually perform the work to produce renewable energy in the communities where they live.
