I'll be there for my shift since no one can take it. I've been sleeping all day... so maybe I just need some fresh air. 

Thanks,

Phoebe

    Hey Michael,

    I'm going to be downtown for Ash Wednesday stuff starting at 5, and I probably won't get back until late, so I cannot cover any of it. 

    Best,
    Tim
