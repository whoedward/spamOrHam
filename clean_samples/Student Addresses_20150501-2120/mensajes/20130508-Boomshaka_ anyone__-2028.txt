HEY FRENDZZZ 

Do you like dancing? Do you like drumming? Do you like slurpees, robots, Wild West shoot-outs, and/or living and breathing? If you answered yes, no, or maybe to any of these questions, then your little booties better be in McCormick Auditorium (aka that theater in Norris) Thursday at 8pm and Friday and Saturday at 8 and 11pm for BOOMSHAKA PRESENTS: CONVERGE!!!!!! Seriously you guys the Boomshaka show is gonna be dope as heckkkkk PLEASE COME SUPPORT YOUR RHYTHMICALLY INCLINED PEERS!!!! Which surprisingly includes me. 

Loves ya,
Xoxo
