Wish you had more face time with Northwestern administrators? Have an idea you want to propose, a question about a policy, or a criticism about a program? 

ASG has coordinated Administrator Round Tables with Northwestern Administrators who can listen to your ideas, understand your criticisms, and answer your questions. 

Every Thursday evening from 7-8 PM, ASG will be hosting a Northwestern Administrator. Each Round Table will be capped at 25 students to facilitate discussion. RSVP for our Winter Series here:
