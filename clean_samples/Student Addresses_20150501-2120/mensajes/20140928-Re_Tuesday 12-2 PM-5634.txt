                                Hi everyone,

                                I know I released this shift on shiftplanning already and a lot of you have responded to the shift already.. but I have class at 1 PM so I really need this covered.
                                If it's just from 1-2PM, that's fine. 

                                Thank you,

                                Phoebe
