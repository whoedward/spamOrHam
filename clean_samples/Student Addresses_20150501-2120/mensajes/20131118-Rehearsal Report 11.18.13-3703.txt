Rehearsal Notes:

    Today was our last day of exclusively table work! We were able to get through most major scenes that hadn’t been dealt with yet, and we’re ready to start doing some blocking tomorrow. We’ll be working our way through the show chronologically for the most part, so we’ll be starting with scene 1.1.
    We effectively worked through five scenes today. Though some of them were short, they were out of order and had many different combinations of people, but the actors were able to put them in context with the rest of the show very well. Things will start coming together with the blocking we’ll be starting tomorrow.
    In terms of timing for blocking, tomorrow will be a bit of an experimental rehearsal. We’ll see how long blocking takes for each scene, as Maia and I are not really sure how best to estimate that right now. Once we have a clearer idea we can make some adjustments to scheduling if need be.

Scenery Notes:
