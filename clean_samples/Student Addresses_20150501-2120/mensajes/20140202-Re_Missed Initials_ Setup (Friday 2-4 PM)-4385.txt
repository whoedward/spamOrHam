Hi Michael,

Sorry for the late reply, I was away from campus all weekend and didn't have access to my email. 

I am aware that we need to be initialing sheets, and I dropped the ball on that. I also didn't realize that Northwestern needed to be cleaned up at 3:30, so that was also my fault. Mostly, this resulted from me being distracted because I was frantically trying to finish an assignment due later in the day. That should not have been my first priority while I was on shift, so I take responsibility for these oversights as I was the supervisor on the shift and should have personally made sure that the shift was running smoothly. In the future, I will make sure I am not distracted from my work with other things while on shift. Let me know if you have any questions.

Initialing keeps everyone accountable and prevents us from wasting our time. Also, not cleaning up an event is not cool. I know you guys are probably not used to that and/or it was just a mistake, so just consider this a first warning of sorts.
