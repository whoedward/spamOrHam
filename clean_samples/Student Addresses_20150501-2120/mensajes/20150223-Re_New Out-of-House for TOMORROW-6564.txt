BUMP.  We still need one person to work tomorrow!  

To recap: leave Norris at 4PM with laptop and projector.  Go to Great Room (where screen will already be) and set it up.  Meeting starts at 5 so, once client gives the ok, you can leave.  Super simple.  No cleanup needed.

    Hello everyone,

     

    For the delivery:  Screen is already there, in a closet.  Satellites staff will help you locate it.

     

    No cleanup needed.  We can leave the equipment for the next day. 

     

    And let’s leave that screen in the Great Room until further notice.  Thanks!

    Hey NTS,

     

    An extra event got added tomorrow (Tuesday, 2/24).  It is at the Great Room and is only a laptop, projector, and screen.  

     

    It is just a delivery.  We need:

     

    Setup: leave Norris 4PM, event starts at 5.  You can leave once the client is comfortable.

     

    Cleanup: event ends at 7, res ends at 7:30.  Clean up everything and take back to Norris.

     

    Please reply ASAP if you can help!  Sorry about the late notice but please respond if you can work.

     

    Best,

    Christina
