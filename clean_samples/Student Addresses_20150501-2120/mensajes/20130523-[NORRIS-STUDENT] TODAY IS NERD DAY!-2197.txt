THE BEST DAY OF THE YEAR! NERD DAY! This should be an easy one, maybe as compared to yesterday--the most interesting, but also pretty accurate winners are  Housestaffers Tess Warzyn and Andres Caneva! Tess looks like Lizzie Maguire's mom (for real) and Andres was a young Tom Cruise. Their pictures are attached.

Here's the rest of our week, with NORRIS PROM TOMORROW! Bring a friend, bring a date, come alone--all your friends will be there! Plenty of food and dancing to put your thrift shop attire to the test, plus prizes for best dressed!

TODAY! THURSDAY 5/23: NERD DAY: Maybe this is the true northwestern spirit day. Maybe this is your true style. Maybe this one is your biggest stretch. I believe in your talents. Embrace your inner Pokemon enthusiast, put on your pocket protector, break out the Star Trek gear, or your old head gear. 

FRIDAY 5/24: NU SPIRIT DAY: All purple everything. 

FRIDAY 5/24 at 8pm: NORRIS PROM! More prizes! Food! Dancing! More costumes!! All your Norris pals, having a good time. Be sure to rock your finest thrifted formalwear, or just whatever you've got.

Who even is who? Tess really captured Jo Maguire's true attitude.
