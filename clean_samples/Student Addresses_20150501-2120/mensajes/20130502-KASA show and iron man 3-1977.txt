Hi everybody,

It has come to my attention that we haven't discussed too much about seeing iron man 3.  Alright, so first and for most I think we need to decide whether or not we are going to see iron man in 3D or regular vision.  I personally like regular vision, but it doesn't lend itself to the best schedule.  So the only time in regular vision is 11:25, after the KASA show (there is no way we can make an 8:30 movie).  However, there are more options for 3D, a 9:15 and 10:45pm showing.  Also, there is no mention of food after the KASA show, which we can probably work out.  

So how about I put up this tentative schedule up, and I'll have people put there input in.

6:45 - 7:00, meet at Bloomquist and start moving mats, paddles and boards

7- 8 - finish setting up mats/warmup/stretch for KASA demo

8:15 - 8:25 - Our awesome demo (presuming that KASA starts late, per usual)

8:25 - 9  - Clean up and store mats in somebody's dorm (I'm giving us a lot of time for this)

9 - 10:30 --> Dinner and grab tickets (we will probably complain about where to go to eat, I want this, and I want that, plus if we are all going then its gonna take a while for us to get served and what not.  Let's just say I've never walked away from a TKD meal and said "wow, I have a lot of time for the rest of the day.")

10:45 -  12:45 -->  We watch iron man in 3D.

Let me know what you think.  We could skip dinner and try to catch an earlier showing, thats totally an option.  We also have practice on Saturday and need to bring the mats back too.  So maybe staying out too late won't be a good idea.
