Hi all.

I will be around Wilkinson around 1:30PM tomorrow(Friday).

If you come, we can have a discussion session about the second and the third projects.

I normally have a TA session on Mondays, but if many of you come tomorrow, I may also hold an extra TA session on Fridays from now on.

I know Wilkinson has a lower capacity than a regular classroom, and I am trying to solve this problem currently.
