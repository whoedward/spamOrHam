Hey guys,

Can I get someone to cover my 10am-12pm shift this Sunday?  I'm not
coming back into town until later that day, but I doubt there's going
to be much going on so I would really appreciate it if someone could
cover it for me.  As always, I'm willing to take one of your shifts if
you want me to.

Thanks,

Will
