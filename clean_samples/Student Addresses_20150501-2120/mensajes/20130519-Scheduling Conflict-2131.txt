Hello Dr. You,

I am emailing you because I have discovered that there is a conflict with the chemical engineering 210 class and the materials science 301 class. There is only one section for each of them, and they are at the same time. Do you have any recommendations for classes that I could take in lieu of mat-sci 301? I am certainly willing to try any other engineering prerequisites or other useful classes that would look good on my resume.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
