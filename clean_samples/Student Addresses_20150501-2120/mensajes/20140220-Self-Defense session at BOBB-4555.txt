Hi guys,

Hope your midterm weeks are going betting than mine!

A CA at Bobb McCulloch contacted us to hold a self-defense workshop in her residential hall. The day is March 1st (Sat) and the exact time is not set yet, but probably in the afternoon. We will be focusing on a group of females. I am thinking of talking briefly about self-defense at the beginning and letting them pair up and try several moves after each demonstration. IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED, PLEASE EMAIL ME!! I really need at least one person who knows a couple of self-defense moves well enough to teach others!! **wink wink JIHOON** Even if you are not an expert on this, we can all learn together before the workshop and help out the students!! So, please let me know asap:)

Best,
Natalie
