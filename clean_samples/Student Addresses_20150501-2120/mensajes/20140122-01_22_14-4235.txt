Hey, guys,

Just a reminder to bring your sparring gears to practice if you have them. Along that note, we were thinking of further differentiating the Wednesday practices. We are planning on having the first hour focus on just the sparring techniques (and therefore open to all members with or without sparring gear) and having the second hour focus on actual contact sparring (not recommended for beginners). This second hour will only be open to those who have full gear, so I would encourage those who want to continue practicing sparring to obtain the full gear.

Also, one of our members, Rui, has invited the club to attend and take part in the NU CSSA Festival on February 8th. We were asked to prepare a short demonstration for the event, so it would be awesome if we could get as many people as possible to prepare for this (ALL MEMBERS, regardless of rank or experience, are welcome). We will begin preparations this Saturday alongside our practice. Please let me know if you want to be a part of this (I encourage everyone to participate!). Also let me know if you have any ideas for the demo~

That is it for now. See you guys later.

Yours,
