Michael,

Are there still concerns about using the Disney character? I tried getting a quote using the gopher image, but it's pretty expensive (looked like ~$500 for 30 t-shirts). Is it possible to see if local print shops around town could give us a better price/help us reduce our costs? I have had some experience making t-shirts with other student groups.
