Performance Notes:

    Our 8 PM performance was good, if a little hindered by the fact that for the first 30 or so minutes the Shanley air conditioner (which we had turned on to combat the stifling heat) was being extremely loud. Karl was able to unplug it at one point, thankfully, at which point it got about 10 times quieter!
    Our 11 PM performance was the best we’ve had yet. Ben Kemper was in the audience, which was exciting. The transitions ran seamlessly, the actors did certain things differently from before and it really moved the show along smoothly. It didn’t drag at all, which was something we had been worried about earlier.
    Thank you to everyone who helped last night! 

Scenery Notes:

    Everything worked great!

Prop Notes:

    Everything worked great!

Costume Notes:

    There were a few things that were not put back in the right place (unclear whether that was the fault of actors or the costume team), but a few items were missing before our 8 PM show. As long as we’re in communication it shouldn’t be a problem, but I’d like for that to not happen again.

Light Notes:

    Everything was great, no problems.

Sound Notes:

    Everything worked great!

Blood Notes:

    Two of our blood bulbs broke, which means we no longer have a backup and are short one. Will you be able to buy some more today?
    Have we found someone to work the blood backstage today in place of one of you?

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Does anyone know where we can get gaff tape and masking tape before tonight’s performances? Masking tape shouldn’t be a problem, but gaff tape is necessary for the blood mechanisms and we ran out last night. Please let me know if you know where to find some!
