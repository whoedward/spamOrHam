Hi y'all.

I have a social planned for this coming Sunday, 5/25/14, of Memorial Day weekend.
We'd be taking a nice stroll down to Main street to the Hoosier Mama/Dollop Coffee, getting pie and hot drinks. Or cold drinks. It will be at 2PM.

I have 15 spots planned. The e-mail for spots will go out Wednesday at 9PM.

Thanks,
Paul Kim
