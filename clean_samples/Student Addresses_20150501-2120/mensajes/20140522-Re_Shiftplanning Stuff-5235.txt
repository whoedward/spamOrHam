For the Friday 4-6, we have not been able to permanently get it covered.  Shiftplanning is wrong; Edward took it from Irene.  I figured since there's only a couple more Fridays, we can cover as we go.

I think that we should email Joanne and Edward about being on shift together, especially since it looks like it will happen on Friday and Sunday.  My gut says that they shouldn't be, since they're still new, however they have both worked a ton of shifts.  They might feel comfortable.  Make sure to check the sheets that nothing unusual is happening.

Let me check my schedule for the Saturday rotation.

    Hi Everyone, 

    Three things:

    I'm not sure what's going on with Friday 4-6. I tried to get that shift permanently covered last week but I wasn't at the meeting. I know it got covered at least for last week, but this week Christina had it on the agenda again, so I assumed that it was just a one-week coverage last week so I got Johanne to cover it this week. But shiftplanning says that Edward and Irene are on it now. So I have no clue what's going on. 

    The Sunday 8-midnight now has Edward and Johanne on it together. Is that a problem or do you think they know what they're doing enough to handle it? 

    Magan emailed me today and he cannot take the Saturday rotation. Can anyone do it? 

    Thanks.
