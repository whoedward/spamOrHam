Hi guys,

For this week's social event, I am thinking of going to NU Nights awesome carnival event held at Norris at 10PM, followed by milkshakes at Fran's Cafe. If you want a break from work, tons of free food and free prizes and the chance to hang out with your awesome floor-mates, you should definitely come!! We are meeting outside my room at 9:45PM and walking over as a floor. Please send me an email if you plan on coming so I know who to wait for. You will get a social point for attending! Hope to see you there!

Best,
Danny
