Hey NTS:
Michael will be out sick for a while, so Dan Foley (who works with Michael in the same office) will be your contact if you need help with anything. However, Dan has other responsibilities so if it's a tech question, feel free to call one of the supervisors and we'll be happy to answer your questions. The supervisors will try to be at Norris more this weekend to help make sure everything runs smoothly and help with larger and more difficult events.
 
Supervisors Phone Numbers:
Ethan Robison (240)625-7932
Christina Spaeth (773)266-0555
Alex Yang (224)600-0997
William Hyun (224)305-4855
Alex Schlehuber (309)533-0550
Michael Wang (937)768-4550
