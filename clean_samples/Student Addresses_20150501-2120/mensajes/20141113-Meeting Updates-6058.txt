Hey everyone!

Thanks for everyone that was able to attend the meeting, and hopefully the EA exam went okay for many of you that were unable to come.  Following up Michaels email, here is the sheet that you guys can put any of your friends information so that we can contact them for the website blurbs as well as the Live CTEC’s.

As an all member action item, like I had mentioned during the meeting I want everyone to reach out to the student groups that you were assigned to invite them to attend the Student Leaders Lunch on Wednesday November 19th from 12-12:50 in the Dean’s Conference room Tech L250.  Let them know that this lunch is an opportunity to interact with the other student leaders to discuss their upcoming events and improve the overall experience of being in a McCormick student group.  Dean Ottino will also be attending this lunch and talking about student groups and initiates that are on their way for McCormick.  The lunch is free and delicious!

If you have any questions let me know!  I will be sending action item emails to all my teams so look out for that as well.

Have a nice weekend,
Jason
