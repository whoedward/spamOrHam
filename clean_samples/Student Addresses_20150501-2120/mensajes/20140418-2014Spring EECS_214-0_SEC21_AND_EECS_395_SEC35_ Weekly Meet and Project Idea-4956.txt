Firstly, fill out this when2meet (courtesy of Ethan) so we can figure a time to meet out of class.  Location is TBD.

Second, fill in your phone number in the Google doc so everyone has each other’s number.  Also I will add everyone to a groupme so we can communicate easier.

As we talked about, the goals for next week are:

1.    1.   To decide on the different components of our project.

2.     2.  Divide the different components among members of the group.

3.     3.  Make a schedule of when each component will be completed, as well as when the final project will be completed.

 

If we keep with the Northwestern-related service, we need to think of different parts we can integrate into our final project.  Examples we talked about are:

·      A course planner where you input time preferences and the classes you want to take.  Also, it should include CTEC integration so you get the highest rated professors.

·      A better way to browse CTECS

·      A weekly schedule with exams and homework assignments due

·      A shuttle finder based on location and time.

 

Try to think of as many additional ideas as you can for the next meeting (which will be our weekly meet before Friday). 

 

We had a very productive first meeting and I’m sure this group is going to work great together.

 

Finally, if anyone has any problems with the assignments or doesn’t really have the time to do them we should all help each other out.
