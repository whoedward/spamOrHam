Hello,

Several days ago I went to the office of the Weinberg dean and had them make a copy of my AP score sheet. Please let me know if you have received the information that you need.

Thanks for the patience,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan,

     

    Thank you for following up on this.

     

    Unfortunately, I am still unable to see it in the system.

     

    The good news is that you can take the paper record to the Weinberg Office at 1922 Sheridan Road and have the Office of Dean Richard Weimer approve your credit. They will be able to have it added to your transcript. This applies to all students, not just Weinberg students.

     

    If you wish to first inquire by phone you may reach them at 847-491-7560. They will be able to provide an e-mail address to which any electronic documents/reports can be sent.

     

    Please let me know if you have any additional issues. Thank you for sticking with thisâ€”hopefully this will be the last hoop that you have to jump through!

     

    Best,
    Sam

    Hello,

    I am emailing you to inquire as to whether or not you have received notification of AP credit. The scores were sent via express to the office. If you do not have record, I can stop by with a paper printout record.

    Thanks,
    Ethan Robison
