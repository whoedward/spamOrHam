Hey ISRC,

Like I mentioned last night, we'll be going ice skating this Sunday. You don't have school on Monday, so just procrastinate all your work until then. I know that there are some NFL games going on, but suck it up or tape it or whatever. I was thinking of leaving at 1:00 and returning at 5:00, before the second game.

ISRC can pay for your skates from Norris. You just need to let me know your shoe size and if you are coming. Let me know as soon as possible, because it will make coordinating the skate rental easier. If you think we should leave at a different time, just let me know in your confirmation email.

Have a great week,
Jonas
