Hi everyone,

I was planning on having practice tomorrow, but I have two projects due at noon on Monday and still a lot of work to do on them. So, there will be no practice.
For anyone that was hoping to have one last practice before summer, I apologize.

I hope you all have a great summer, and you'll be hearing from me next fall.

peace,
Jacob
