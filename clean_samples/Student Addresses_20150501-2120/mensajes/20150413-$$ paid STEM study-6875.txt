Hi all from EECS,

 

My name is Jue Wu. I am a Learning Sciences MA student in the School of Education and Social Policy. I am conducting a study on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) students, and would like to invite you to participate in my study. The principle investigator of this study is Dr. David Uttal from the Department of Psychology and School of Education and Social Policy. The IRB No. of this study is STU00200419.

 

I would like to conduct interviews on STEM joiners (students who join STEM from undeclared major or from non-STEM fields). The open-ended interview will center on your life story related to the decision of joining STEM, and will last around an hour on campus in Evanston. There is no right or wrong answer to the interview question. Audio recording is required for the interview.

 

As a thank you for your participation, you will receive $10 for your interview.

 

Please let me know if you are eligible for the study and if you are interested in the study. Feel free to ask me if you have any question about the study. Thank you.
