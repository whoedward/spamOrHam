Hello everyone,

I hope y'all had a lovely break and are managing to get back to campus okay. At this point in time, our prod meeting for tonight at 10:30 PM in the Big 10 Room is still on. L&M is still expecting final design presentations from us tomorrow (Monday) night at 10:45 in the Lake Room, and enough people seem to be making it back okay so we are going to stay on course. If you are having problems making it back to campus, please let me know ASAP; in the event that enough people can't make it back we will reschedule. 

So, just to review the current plan of action as of now:
TONIGHT, 10:30 @ Big 10 Room - Prod Meeting/Final Designs (everyone!)
TMRW, 10:45 @ Lake Room - L&M Design Presentations (lead designers)

A few more things:
-BUILD!! Build starts this Saturday at the WAVE garage (behind 617 Noyes)! Sign up here! If everyone can try and commit to three hours of build across our three weekends, that would be fantastic. 
-BAKE SALE!! We will be having our first bake sale at the Rock this Friday! Sign up for a shift or to bake here!
-INDIEGOGO!! Our Indiegogo launches tomorrow! Stay tuned for a link so you can share it all over the place!

I know the snow/sub-zero temperatures are pretty nasty and I would like to apologize on behalf of the weather. It sucks but we are heading into our final few weeks and we have to stay on course. Please stay warm while traveling outside... cover every inch of skin, wear dozens of layers and move quickly but safely. Final note: if anyone has a car and would be willing to drive people to the meeting(s), let me know! Love you all! Let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

All the best,
Matt
