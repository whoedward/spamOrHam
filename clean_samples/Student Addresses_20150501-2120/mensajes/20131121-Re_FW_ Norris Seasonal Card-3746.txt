Well, we can always try!  Although my guess is that, unless a super is on the shift to make it happen, it most likely won't.  But it can't hurt to request it of NTS.

    Good afternoon everyone,

     

    The Norris Student Employment Committee is requesting your help in getting students on this year’s Norris seasonal card.  To do this, we are asking departments with student employees to take a staff picture (with as much Northwestern Purple as you can) and submit it to norrisemployment@u.northwestern.edu as soon as possible.  The absolute deadline is this Tuesday, November 26th.

     

    Best regards,

     

    Frank
