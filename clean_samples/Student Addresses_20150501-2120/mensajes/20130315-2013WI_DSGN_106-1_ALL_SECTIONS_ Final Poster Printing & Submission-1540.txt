Hello all,
Firstly, I'm sorry for all of the confusion regarding printing: the library plotter breaking down is out of our hands. That said, if you have not printed your poster yet, please respond to this email with your section and team number.

Even if you have already contacted your professor, myself, or another TA: if at this moment you have not yet printed--please respond to this email with your information. We're making alternate printing arrangements.

Another reminder: please email your poster file to me! It is not optional, professors are looking for them.

Thank you for your patience, we'll get it all sorted out before tomorrow.
-Sam
