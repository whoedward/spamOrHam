AIESEC Northwestern Fall 2014 Recruitment

 
AIESEC, the world's largest student-run organization, develops leaders in two ways: giving students a volunteer or work experience abroad (Global Citizen) and the opportunity to manage exchange programs (Global Leader). Watch this clip to understand our "why": http://bit.ly/1gezD4n
For our current Fall Recruitment, we are looking specifically for NU students to join our Global Leader program. The Global Leader program is an experiential learning and development platform created for students, by students. We are a movement of “do-ers” – giving those who participate in our programs the unique advantage of being a part of something bigger than themselves. Participants gain practical skills and insights by running AIESEC’s exchange operations, experiencing positions of leadership and acquiring a global mindset.
Want to apply? Here is the link to our application:
