Hi Greer,

That's totally okay! We're sorry to not have a chance to work with you, but no hard feelings. 

There isn't any paperwork or anything to take care of, so no worries.

Best of luck to you!

Best,
Ethan

    Hi Ethan!

    I'm sorry for the confusion, but I wasn't aware I had applied for a Fall position, and just accepted another work study job. Apologies again. If I need to fill anything out to change this, let me know.

        We'd like to get you started here as soon as possible, if that works for you.

        If you are available, any dates from September 15th through the 24th (09/15/2014 - 09/24/2014) would be excellent for an opportunity to train you on all of the skills that you'll need for the position.

        Please let me know if any of these days work for you.If not, please let us know what does work.

        Looking forward to hearing from you.

        Best,
