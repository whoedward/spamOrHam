        These seem excellent. Perhaps a role centered around helping meetings go smoothly (although this could be part of another role).

            Supes,

            I know we talked about job roles last summer and I thought they were a really good idea. I think we should try to formalize a list of these. So far I have:

                Hiring and Resume Review
                ShiftPlanning and Time Conflict Resolution
                Lab Maintenance/Trash Duty
                Discipline

            I feel like if we rotate these among the supers on a weekly basis, it will increase our job awareness and prevent burnout. If anyone has extra categories they can think of, let me know, otherwise I will try to create a rotating board.
