Hey everyone,

Just wanted to send out a quick reminder to please pay your club dues if you haven't already.  Unless you've already talked with me and made arrangements, dues are $35 per person.  Again, the dues are used to pay for the instruction we get, so it's very important that we get payment from everyone.

So yeah, if you haven't already, just bring a check or cash by during practice.

Your treasurer,
Allan
