    Hi everyone,

    We don't have a meeting room for tonight's meeting, but we're still planning to hold one. It will still be from 7-8pm, but be on the lookout for an email saying where we're having the meeting. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason.

    Thanks,
