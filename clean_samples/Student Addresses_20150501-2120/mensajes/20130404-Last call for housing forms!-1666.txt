I need your Letter of Intent completed and returned to me by 12 p.m. (noon) tomorrow! Slide them under my door, room 309.

Remember: you cannot submit a letter of intent and enter the housing lottery. Pick one.

Please also e-mail me your top three room preferences by 11:59 p.m. on Monday, April 5. Roommates can send their preferences in together.
