Oh, and before I forget!

Pius, don't forget your camera. If anyone else has a video camera, you should bring it as well.

Also, if you still need a mouthpiece, there are sporting goods stores near Purdue where we can pick one up. (Stores in Evanston aren't open at 6 AM, unfortunately)

    Hey everyone,

    The purdue tournament is this Saturday, so there will be no Saturday practice.

    For those of you who are going to compete, we are meeting in the Blomquist parking lot at 6 AM. Set your alarms accordingly and try not to party too hard tonight. Also, bring $20. Because that's how much registration costs for sparring, forms, and/or both. ;)

    By the way, in case anyone is wondering who is going to compete:

    Ji-hoon Kim
    Daniel Sauza
    Allan Dong
    Pius Kim
    Albert Hong

    Everyone's doing sparring, and I'm doing both sparring and forms. Not sure who else is doing forms. Wish us all luck and see you all at practice Monday except the people listed above whom I'll see in the cold, dark parking lot at Blom.

    Ji-hoon
