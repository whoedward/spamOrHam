Hi guys,

Hope you all had a wonderful winter break! Judo classes will resume tomorrow at Blomquist from 8-9:30pm. Don't worry if you've forgotten a lot because it's been a while. We will be spending some quality time reviewing tomorrow. Classes have barely started so there's no excuse to not come! See you all tomorrow.
