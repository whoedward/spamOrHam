Thanks, Leon!  Will you be taking part or all of the shift?

        Hello NTS,

        Sorry to bother when I know so many others need coverage, but would someone be willing to cover me for one hour (or both) on Wednesday morning from 10 am to 11?  I have a meeting with my Fellowship Advisor that I unwittingly scheduled for 10 am just now; it would be a great help to me if you could cover me partially for that time.

        Thanks for all the hard work, and Godspeed with class registration!
