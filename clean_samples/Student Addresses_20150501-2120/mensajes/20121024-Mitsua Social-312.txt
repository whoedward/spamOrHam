Hey everyone,

The master staff and exec are currently planning a social to the Mitsua Marketplace on Saturday November 17th, a Japanese market in Arlington Heights. The time commitment would be from 11:00-3:30. We are in the process of reserving busses and need to know how many people would be seriously interested in coming. What type of bus we order will depend upon your responses. If you are sure that you would come please mark yes on the survey monkey, if not, please mark no. Please check your schedules to see if you can make it/if you are interested in coming.

Here is the survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Y93R6YH


Thanks for your help,

Anthony
