Hello!

I just came across an opportunity to go to a concert tonight and I would have to miss my shift if I went

I’m on the extra tech shift from 7-9:30. Could someone cover this? I do remember this being discussed as a shift that wasn’t entirely needed.

I’ll cover it if no one else can but I’d really like to go to the concert! thanks!
