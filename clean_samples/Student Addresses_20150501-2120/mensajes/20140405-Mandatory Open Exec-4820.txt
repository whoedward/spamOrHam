Hello ISRC!!

First off I hope you all had a wonderful Spring Break, and a great start to Spring Quarter. Since this is the first quarter with the new Exec Board, there will be a MANDATORY Open Exec TOMORROW (5/6) at 8:30pm. This is a chance for you all to get to know the new Exec Board, and to bring up any ideas that you have for our last quarter of the year!!! 

Best,
Esteban
