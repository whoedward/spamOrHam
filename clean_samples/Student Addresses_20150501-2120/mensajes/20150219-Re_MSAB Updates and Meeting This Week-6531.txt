    Hi all!

    At our last meeting, we talked about getting all of our projects back on track and moving forward with the projects we’re working on. We’ve also developed a weekly check-in form for all of the projects. If you’re the lead of a project (listed as follows), please copy this form into the google folder for your project and fill out as much of it as you can for the meeting this week. During the meeting, we’ll be pulling up these forms to discuss and evaluate next steps for each project.

        Senior Sendoff- Jane and Jason

        Freshman Handbook- Kelly

        E-Week- Michael and Brennan

        Research Initiatives- Wenli

        Student Group Funding- Greg

        Dinner with 12 Strangers- Jui and Brianna

        Student Group Liaison- Alisa


    As a reminder---our meetings are going to remain at 6:00 pm on Thursdays for the rest of the quarter. We’ll be meeting in the Dean’s Conference Room again this week.

    Please email me or Brennan if you won’t be able to make it.

    Thanks!
