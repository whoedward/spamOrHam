Hey Juan,

Just a quick heads up about a missed swipe that you had on 3/4 (I know that it was forever ago). Really, I just wanted to make sure that you remember the importance of swiping in and out correctly. If you have any questions, or if you remember the circumstances surrounding that particular missed swipe, please let me or one of the other supers know.

Regards,
