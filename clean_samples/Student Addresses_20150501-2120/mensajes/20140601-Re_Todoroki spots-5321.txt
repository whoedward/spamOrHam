Hi all,
We have reached capacity for the social (!!) If you e-mail me, I can get you a spot on the waitlist.

Thanks,

    Hey all,

    I had a problem with Boomerang, the app I use to send e-mails at a later date. That's completely my fault. Here is the e-mail for signing up to go to Todoroki, 20 minutes after promised.

    E-mail me for a Todoroki spot! The social is on Wednesday, June 4th, at 12:30pm.

    Thanks,
    Paul Kim
