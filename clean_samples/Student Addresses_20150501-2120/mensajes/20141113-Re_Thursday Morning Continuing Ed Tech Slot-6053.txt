Hey Justin,

First of all, I want to apologize for the absolute fracas that was the opening shift today. To the best of my knowledge, it was the intersection of three fairly unlikely occurrences.

The gist of my absence for the Continuing Ed. was that I thought that someone had covered it for me (I was cleaning up an event at the Great Room during the beginning of the meeting last night), and it was not. So, I will be on the shift for now. I don't have any other excuse than that, sadly.

I want to apologize again and to assure you that things will be smoother in the future.

Sincerely,
Ethan

    Hey Ethan,

     

    Just wanted to check in about who is supposed to be working this slot because on shiftplanning your name is still listed but the CM notified me that she was notified that you no longer work this shift.  If thatâ€™s the case can you give me a bit of clarification as to whether or not there is a new dedicated tech for this event now or if the shift has yet to be covered now that you are not working it?

     

    Go Cats!
