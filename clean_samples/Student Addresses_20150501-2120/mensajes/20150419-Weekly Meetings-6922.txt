Daniel,

Thanks for submitting your paperwork! Please come to our weekly meetings, which are Wednesdays at 7PM. The location is TBA, but we usually email the information out beforehand.

At the meeting, we'll get you introduced to the rest of the staff, and we will also give you on some shifts. Please come prepared with your availability!

From,
Michael Wang
