Hello Dr. Goodman,

My name is Ethan Robison. I am a Norris supervisor. I was present at your presentation concerning leadership yesterday.
I am highly interested in leadership and learning about leadership. If you have any literature or recommended readings on the subject, I would love to hear what you have to say.
Additionally, if it isn't too much to ask, I would very much like to sit down with you and discuss leadership with you. Let me know if you have anything of that sort in mind.

Best,
Ethan Robison
