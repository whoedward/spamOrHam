Hey everyone!
 
I hope you've enjoyed the long weekend.  It's hard to believe that our hot chocolate sale is only a little over 12 hours away, but it starts at 9 AM tomorrow.
 
There are still a few shifts that nobody's signed up for.  If you can sign up for these shifts, please do it.  You'll get philanthropy points if you do.  And you'll be raising money for ISRC's DM team.  So please give a hand!
