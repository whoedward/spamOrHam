Good afternoon Techies!

I hope this fine Friday finds you well, even if the weather won't.

A few housecleaning tips from the lady who brought you "Check your sheets!" and "Do your sweeps!":

Please do it.  We had a last minute catch for a client (who shall remain unnamed) today because either there was a misreading of the sheets or a miscommunication error in which communication between the client and whoever was on shift for the res time did not take place.  Jank, guys.

Also!  Our lab and lounge are meant to be sanctuaries for all who may stray into them--please, please, please keep them neat.  When you have garbage, or you've just finished a meal, DO NOT just leave it sitting there like nobody's business, just because there is no trash can in the immediate vicinity.  Real jank.

And lastly (on positive note, thank God.  I'm starting to sound like my mother...)!  I am now typing this edifying email on the new laptop system set up in the lounge for our (meaning exclusively techs) use!  Wowzers!  Real internet, with a real connection in the comfort of our own pad!  Whew.  That said, please do not abuse this privilege (i.e. download or revel in unsavory material that would otherwise attract attention to ourselves).

...That's all there is--there isn't anymore (aren't you glad?).

With all due respect,

Marina
