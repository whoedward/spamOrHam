Executive Summary 
can we use exercise control instead of has?
"For this reason Brian's parents" will need a comma. Actually I think there are numerous places commas should be, and Herrick loves to circle those.
Instead of "allow Brian complete control over when he turns himself over in bed." can we say "allow Brian complete control over turning himself in bed." It's significantly less wordy.
"and a programmed arduino computer chip" we should add "equipped with sensors.
"independence on when to switch positions" is sorta awkward. Does "independence in switching positions" work?

Introduction
"reduced reduced" shouldn't be there
"Therefore, the device" let's say "Therefore, our solution"

Users and Requirements
We should probably numerically label subsections, like 2.X.X. We should do this on the introduction too.
In Requirements "parents" should be possessive.

Arduino should always be capitalized
In the 3.3.2, the design rationale for the motor, the phrase "Brian was unable to exert enough force to pull himself through any means" is not true and is a little demeaning. We should says something like. "Brian was unable to exert enough force to use our self-powered designs." 

In 3.5.1 we say the tensioner extends by 4-5 inches. That seems uncertain. Let's make it seem definitive.
