Hey,
 
This is just a reminder that the Free Norris Leisure 9-Ball League is now underway, which means that your chance to win a $100 Target Gift Card is almost gone. So if you haven't signed-up yet but are interested in playing some free pool, meeting some new people, and competing for the grand prize, email me as soon as possible so we can find a way to fit you in. Sign-up will officially close at 11:59 pm on Tuesday, February 19th.
 
Tournament Coordinator: Harry Briggs

The tournament Rules and Regulations are attached for those of you who are interested. Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Best of luck! I hope to see you guys down in the Game Room!
 
Harry
