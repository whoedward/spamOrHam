Hello Dr. You,

I am emailing you regarding my schedule for this quarter. There is a scheduling conflict with my DTC class caused by my calculus and organic chemistry lectures. There are no arrangements that allow me to take all three unless I take the 7:40 a.m. class. However, this class is full and therefore inaccessible to me. If it is at all possible, I would like special permission to be enrolled in this class. If there is anything at all that you need from me to make this happen, please let me know.

Thank you,
Ethan Robison
