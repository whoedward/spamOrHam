Hey Norris Student Staff,

As the year is coming to a close and we're all bogged down with studying for finals and writing papers (or maybe just waiting for flights home), it's time we take a study break at Norris! Head down to the Game Room on Tuesday, June 11th between 4 and 6pm for free snacks, games, and one last chance to hang out with your friends before the summer. Put that studying on hold for a moment, because you're worth it.

See you there!

Meredith
