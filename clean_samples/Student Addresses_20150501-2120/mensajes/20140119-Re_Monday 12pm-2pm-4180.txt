        Hi Everyone,

        Would anyone be interested in working the 12pm-2pm shift on Monday? I need to drive out to the suburbs to pick up some rental equipment and I want to make sure I have enough time to get there and back.

        The shift has been released on ShiftPlanning as well.

        Thanks!
        Bobby Ramirez
