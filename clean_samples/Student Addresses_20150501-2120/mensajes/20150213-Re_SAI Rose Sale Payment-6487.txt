Hi Tasha,

I can pay upon pick-up, as long as that's alright.

Best,
Ethan

    Hello,

    We have received your order of 1 roses.  Your order is listed as UNPAID as of today.  Please let me know if you will be visiting our table at Norris or Tech later today or will pay when you come to pick up the roses.  You also could give the money to a SAI member, but let me know if you plan to do this.

    Thank you,
    Tasha Heryla
    SAI Winter Fundraising Chair
