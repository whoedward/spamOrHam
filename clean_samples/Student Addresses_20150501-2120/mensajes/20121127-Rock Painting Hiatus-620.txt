Dear friends, 

In preparation for the candlelight vigil remembering Alyssa Weaver on Thursday, Chi Omega plans to paint the rock all whiteon Wednesday night. At the vigil, everyone will have the opportunity to sign the rock. We would like to ask the community to refrain from painting the Rock until after Alyssa's funeral on December 9th in Virginia. I would greatly appreciate it if you could pass this information along to the members of your organization.  Your help is greatly appreciated.  

Sincerely, 
Sarah Bridgewaters
