Supes,

I think that we should change the points system. We currently have a 3 point system (1 - warning, 2 - sit down, 3 - termination), but I've never seen anyone get a second point, because a sit down after two mistakes is kind of unnecessary.

I propose we move to a 5 points system:
Points 1-4: Strikes
Point 5: Sit down w/ a super and/or Michael
Afterwards, it will depend but if it's serious enough, then it can be termination.

This way, we can enforce rules more consistently. We can give points for not initialing the sheets, for example, while in the old system it would just be too harsh.

1 Strike Penalty:

    Showing up more than 15 minutes late
    Not initialing the sheets
    Not doing set-ups/clean-ups or sweeps
    Not wearing a Norris t-shirt

Let me know what you think
