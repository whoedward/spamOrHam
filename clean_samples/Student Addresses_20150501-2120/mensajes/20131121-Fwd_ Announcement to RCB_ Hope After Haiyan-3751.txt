Last weekend, super typhoon Haiyan ravaged the Philippines.

Cities and towns were demolished, families and communities were torn apart.

The number of people affected has increased to 11.8 million, with 900,000 displaced.

 

We are extremely grateful to all of you who have extended your help thus far.

 

Today, we ask you to give more and help us, as one community, reach our goal:

to raise $20,000

and together have a truly significant impact on the survivors of this tragedy.
