Hi all,

Hope you don't have any plans for Saturday lunch- because ISRC is going to DONUTS and EATALY
(Donuts: Firecakes: http://firecakesdonuts.com/ and/or Glazed & Infused: https://www.goglazed.com/
Eataly: http://www.eataly.com/eataly-chicago/)

So, yeah, it's a food social pretty much. I'm planning on leaving at noon on Saturday and getting back at around 4-4:30, though y'all can leave whenever, really.

I plan on taking 14 people, y'all will have to cover the L costs but other than that it's on ISRC. 14 is flexible though, so no worries about that.

I will send an e-mail out on Thursday evening at 8 PM if you would like a spot. Please respond to that e-mail, not this one- if you respond to this one requesting a spot, nothing will happen. You won't be denied one, but I'll literally just tell you to respond to the email that I'll send on Thursday. 

Great, I'm excited. Hear from y'all Thursday!
Paul this is Paul
