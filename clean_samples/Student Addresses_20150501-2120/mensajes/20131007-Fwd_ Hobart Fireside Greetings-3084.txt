Hi Kyle,
 Can you forward this to your house? Thank you so much!

Dear  Friends, 
Just a reminder that this Tuesday at 5pm at Hobart House, we will have CAPS coming in to do a fireside/training on suicide prevention & stress relief! This is a super cool event that you can learn how to  

Question someone about potential suicidal thoughts
Persuade them to seek help
Refer them for professional assistance 
YOU COULD SAFE A LIFE!

Fill out the following registration form as CAPS will bring the training materials based on the number of registration(takes 3 minutes).

    Hi Kyle, 
    I'll definitely forward the ISRC fireside to Ho House! Meanwhile, CAPS has sent their official flyer for the QPR fireside on suicide prevention and stress relief. Can you forward it to your house, and tell them to fill out a form if they are attending the training ( I finished it in 3 min)?

        That's awesome, Jenny! Thanks, I'll bring it up at the open exec meeting we're having tonight.

        Here's the flyer for our first fireside. Feel free to invite people from Hobart to attend!

        Btw you should view it in word because it gets messed up in the google preview thing.

            Hi Kyle, 
            I'm Jenny Wang, and we just met at the RCB meeting. The attachments are the two firesides posters. It would be great if you tell your residents about these events, as you know we are girls dorm and are particularly lack of guys for the swing dance fireside. We can also have joint firesides in the future!! For the CAPS one, I think it's especially useful for the freshmen, but I'm still waiting for the CAPS to send me a registration link for that one. I'll forward you the link once I get it! Nice meeting you and have a great day!
