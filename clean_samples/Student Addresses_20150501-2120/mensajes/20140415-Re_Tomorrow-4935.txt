Certainly. As a heads up, my class finishes at around 12:50, so that's about when I will be ready to go.

    Not sure but we could be done as early as 11:45 and be close to Evanston by 12 or 12:15 ( never know when my vet will be running behind but Hal's treatment is about 1/2 hr.) I usually take Western to Asbury to Green Bay but I could go up to Sheridan and pick you up near school someplace. I can give you a call tomorrow when I know the timing, does that sound ok?

It could give us a little more time ( I'm coming from N Rockwell and I usually take Asbury to Green Bay) I am trying to get to an acupuncture appt by 5 as well
