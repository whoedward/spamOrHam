Hi everyone,

Most of you are probably familiar with the scoring systems used in most tournaments. A few high end tournaments use electronic hogus, but most still have corner judges keeping track of points, a center judge, and an operator working the computer system from behind a table.

These systems are usually pretty expensive to buy, so I'm currently trying to make one myself for the club to use. I've created a working prototype that you can try for yourself on your own computer. 

If you'd like to try it out, just reply back saying you want to test it out, and I'll share the dropbox folder with you.

For Windows users:
Download and unzip. Then open either the Windows32 or 64 bit folder. Double click TKD_sparring_point_system to run the program.

For Mac users (sorry guys, it's a little more complex for you):
Download and unzip. Open the Terminal application on your Mac. Navigate to wherever you unzipped the file. Type the following:

chmod +x TKD_sparring_point_system.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub

Let me know what you think!

Ji-hoon
