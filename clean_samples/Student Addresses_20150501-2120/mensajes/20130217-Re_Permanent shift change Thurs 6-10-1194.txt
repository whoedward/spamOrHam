Hey Athif, 

Do you want to switch your Thursday 8-10 pm with my Monday 6-8 pm?

    Hi all,
    I was wondering if anyone could do a permanent shift change Thursday 6-10, if you want only to take 6-8 or 8-10 that's ok too. As for me I would prefer weekends or early week days after 4
    thanks,
    Athif
