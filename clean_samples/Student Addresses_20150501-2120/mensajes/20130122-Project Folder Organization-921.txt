Hello Again Professor,

You mentioned today in class that team members should maintain a thorough and extensive project folder, which should be divided into several sections, The members of Team Four were wondering what, specifically, this meant. If you could please elaborate, that would be excellent.

Thank you for your time (yet again),
Team Four
