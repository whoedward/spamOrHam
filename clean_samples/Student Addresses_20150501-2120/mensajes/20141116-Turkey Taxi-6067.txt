Hi ISRCers!

Our final philanthropy event of the quarter is RCB's Turkey Taxi! Each Res College needs to put together a box of thanksgiving food for a family. We have decided to divide the items by suite. I have attached a form where your suite can commit to buying a food item. If you do not do this by 9 pm Monday night, I will assign you one. 
The members of your suite will be in charge of buying this ingredient and getting it to me (room 304) by Thursday November 20 at 9 pm. I will let you decide as a suite how you will go about getting the food, but if you have any questions or concerns, let me know. 
Thank you all for participating!
