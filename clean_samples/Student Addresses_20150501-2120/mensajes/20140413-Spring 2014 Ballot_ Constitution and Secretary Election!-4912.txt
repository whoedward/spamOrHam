Hey ISRCers!

Here is the ballot you can vote on. There are two issues: Constitutional Amendments and the Secretary Vacancy Election. Please note that if you do not pass the amendments made to the Constitution, the candidate running will not be eligible for the Secretary position. 

The constitutional changes are in the attached document marked in red.

The ballot will close at 10 PM on April 14, 2014. Please vote and encourage your friends in ISRC to vote too!
