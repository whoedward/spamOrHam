Hello lovely Romans,

WE DID IT. Congratulations one and all for your hard work in making Caesar a kick-ass reality. I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to work with each and every one of you in this truly incredible process. Please know that moving forward, I will not go away as a friend/resource; if there is anything you need, or you just want to talk, I am here for you. Conspirators have each other's backs.

Some final pieces of business to take care of--- RECEIPTS. I plan to be in Norris for most of the day tomorrow (with the exception of a small window around 1), so come and give me receipts! I am going to set up shop on the ground floor, so come and find me with receipts/questions/concerns of any sort. Please try and turn in all receipts to me by tomorrow night before 10:30... if y'all can't make it to Norris tomorrow or can't get receipts to me for some reason, just shoot me a text and we will coordinate. 

Once again, congratulations and thank you for all of your hard work and enthusiasm. Go forth and prosper.

All the best,
Matt
