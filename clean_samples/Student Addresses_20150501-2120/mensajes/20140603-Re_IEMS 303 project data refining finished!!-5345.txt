        Hey guys I was finally able to sort out the data and uploaded them on to our drive. 

        Reminder: 
              There are 763 people on our list
              I deleted people who did not participate less than 1 month. From one of my citations it says we need to delet people whose duration is less than 6 months (which still leaves us with 500 people), but I guess for our research it won't really matter. 
              Also all the people in our list has at least recorded their weights twice, if the record is only once, the BMI change would be 0, so there would be no point of analyzing them. 

        Also when is good time to meet tomorrow? I'm free after 1 pm. 
        I know that it's finals week and everybody is busy, but we gotta put our efforts together and work as a team. 

        June

            Hi, guys,

            Juan and I just found that the duplicated data had been moved for unknown reason from the raw data. June will check the original data tomorrow morning and we will try to catch up with our original schedule ASAP.

            Sorry for the inconvenience.

            Best,
            Xiaolin

                I will be free after the class if my advisor does not schedule any meeting.
