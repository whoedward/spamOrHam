No... I left a little before Maya (Satellite Venues), so you could ask her. But we did not find one while I was there.

    Did anybody see a lost iPad last night after the Veritas event in Ryan Auditorium last night?

     

    Michael – can you ask Ethan?

    Jason – is there a lost and found at Tech for things like this?

     

    Best,

    Hi, 

     

    I was the student emcee at the Veritas Forum hosted last night at the Ryan Auditorium in Tech and left an iPad by the podium/backstage area. I was wondering if there was a Tech/McCormick lost and found or if I could contact the student workers that were helping that night. There were three students, 2 females and a male named Ethan, to my memory. 

     

    Thanks for your help!
