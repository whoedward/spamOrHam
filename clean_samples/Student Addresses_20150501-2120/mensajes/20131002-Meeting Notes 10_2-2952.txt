Hi everyone, here are the notes from tonight's meeting.

Announcements -

From now on, shift coverages sent over the listserv/Shiftplanning must be sent 24 hours in advance. If you do not send out the coverage out in time, the shift is still yours, regardless of whether or not you found coverage. Emergencies are handled on a case-by-case basis by the supervisors. This is to help make sure we have people on for every shift, as it is frustrating and extremely difficult to manage sudden shift coverages. If you have any questions/concerns about the policy, email ntssupervisors@gmail.com

If you are working a shift that bookends a class, you may leave your shift early/arrive slightly late without any problems. Just make sure that the other person on shift/people before and after you know about this. If you taking over or handing off a shift in a situation like this, please consider waiting for the next person to show up/coming on shift early to make sure we have good communication/no events are being missed.

Permanent Shift Coverages

Will wants to get rid of his Friday 10am-12pm Shift
Angela wants to get rid of her Monday 12pm-2pm and Wednesday 6pm-8pm shifts.

If you can take any of these shifts, or which to get rid of any of your shifts, email me and I'll get it into the system.

Link to the schedule if you don't have it yet - make sure you keep track of the shifts you picked up/gave away this week.
