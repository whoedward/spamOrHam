Hello Michael,

Jacob T., Kate Mathias, and myself were involved in the set-up of NU Nights last Friday.  I'm not sure if I remember correctly (and Jacob, correct me if I'm wrong), but I think I recall Jacob saying about how he placed the laptop bags and a cart in one of the Housestaff closets (the one right next to Louis I presume) for safekeeping.  Kate and I remembered, but for some reason, none of our ring keys would work in unlocking the door.  I would give it a check just in case.

Sorry for the trouble,

Marina

    We are missing all of our laptop bags- if you remember leaving them somewhere please let me know ASAP.  In the future if you place bags or any other supplies in a central location please leave notes on the sheets so we can find them.
