Hey, guys,

I just wanted to let you know that Blom will be closed because of MLK Day, so there will be no practice then.

Also, we still need some volunteers who can help out at the Activities Fair this Wednesday. Specifically, we need some people from 2-3 P.M (or even earlier, for that matter) and some from 4-5 P.M. Let me know if you can volunteer~

Thanks, guys!

Yours,
Davin
