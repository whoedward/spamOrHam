All first-year students (freshman and new transfers),
Hopefully your first day (or week) was super awesome! Tomorrow will be another fun day. Just to let you know I changed my plan a little from what I told you earlier. So, we will meet- AND LEAVE FOR BREAKFAST IN HINMAN- in the suite where my room is (blue suite) at 7:25am. As I told some of you already, I believe punctuality is an important thing to have in life, so I will leave at EXACTLY 7:25am and I WILL NOT WAIT. I am doing this not because I have just decided to be mean, but because I care about you guys. So good night, and see you bright and early tomorrow at 7:25am.
Your CA,
Matt
