Hey Alex,

Thank you so much! I just realized that I completely forgot to put the hours in this email. The shift is Sunday 10am-6pm. You are an absolute life saver, I can't thank you enough.

Jake

        Hello again everyone,

        So I still need shift coverage for this Sunday, because I'll definitely be out of town, and that would be 8 hours of work missing a tech. Please please please, if you can work Sunday, please take however much of the shift you're able. I would really appreciate it, and will gladly cover any shifts I can cover for you in return. Additional incentive possible, within reason.

        Thank you,
        Jake Degler
