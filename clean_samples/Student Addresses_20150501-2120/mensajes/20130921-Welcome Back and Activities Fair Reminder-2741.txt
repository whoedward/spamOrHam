Hi, all,

Welcome back! I hope you guys all had a memorable summer and a safe trip back. I myself enjoyed my own summer. I also hope that you guys are looking forward to another great year together.

The first practice of the year will be on September 30th (Monday) at 8:00 P.M. Before you guys come to the first practice, I need you all to sign the Waiver and Consent Form, which is linked below. Make sure you guys fill it out before coming to the first practice. I will send out another notification about this later in the week after the Fall Activities Fair, which is tomorrow.

For those of you guys who have signed up to help out at the fair, we really appreciate it. Even if you haven't signed up, feel free to just drop by at our table in Norris. We will be there from 12:30 P.M. to a little past 5 P.M. Make sure to wear your uniforms if you plan on helping out.

I look forward to seeing all of you either tomorrow or on the first day of practice. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me or any of the other officers.

Sincerely,
Davin

Waiver and Consent Form is available at www.nuim.net/clubsports/index.php at the bottom of the page. Make sure you guys fill it out for Tae Kwon Do-WTF.
