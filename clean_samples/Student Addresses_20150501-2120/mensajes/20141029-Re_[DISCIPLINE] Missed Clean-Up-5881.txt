There was definitely no event for Wildcat in our sheets. I also told Michael when I gave him my Walkie that the people in Wildcat had requested a laptop for their event and it wasn't on the sheets. They hadn't given us an indication of when their event would end either.

    Hey guys,

    Today there was an event in Wildcat that was left uncleaned from your shift. I talked to Phoebe and it appears it was probably a mistake, but in our case it actually delayed the set up for an event in the room later that day, so please double-check the sheets a little more carefully in the future.
