If I recall correctly, Alex is on from 1- around 6 or 7, when Tim goes and closes the event.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

    Hey Folks,

    I was just looking at the schedule and we have a day time run-through today at Ryan for the NU alcohol essentials program.  Do we have someone on that?  Iâ€™m going to send over a tech on duty- please let me know if we already have it covered.
