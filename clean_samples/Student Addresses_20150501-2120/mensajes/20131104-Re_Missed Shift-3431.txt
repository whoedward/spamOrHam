Consider us aware. What this means is more that we'll have to throw Braelyn a bone should she miss a shift.
No skin off my back about a formal warning, just be sure to be on point.

Best,
Ethan

    Supes,

    I missed my 8-10 shift this morning... I'm sending an email to Braelyn, who was on shift, but I think someone should probably send me a formal warning (or at least be aware).

    From,
    Michael Wang
