You will not receive the name of your target until you have read all of the following rules. 

How to play: You will be given a target to "kill." Do so by hitting him/her with a pair of clean, rolled-up socks. If successful, you will then receive his/her target as your new target. 

Kills
1. A kill does not count if seen by another ISRC resident, regardless of whether or not he/she is playing. 
2. The socks must hit the physical body of your target. If blocked or deflected, such as with a textbook or another person, the kill does not count. 
3. You may carry up to and no more than 2 pairs of socks at any given time. 

Restrictions
1. Personal rooms, bathrooms, and classes are off-limits. 
2. Safety hours are between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. every day. Please be considerate of quiet hours in the dorm. 

After you kill
1. All kills must be reported, by both the killer and the killed, to Hannah, through e-mail or Facebook, within 24 hours. 
2. My call is final. I will try to be as fair and objective as possible. 

General
1. Any person-to-person physical contact will result in disqualification: no hitting, pushing, grabbing, etc. Respect personal boundaries. 
2. The game begins Tuesday, March 5 at 8 p.m. and ends on Saturday, March 16 at 8 p.m. 
3. The winner will be decided in one of the following ways: Only person left in the game or most kills. 
4. If a tiebreaker is required, it will take place on Sunday, March 17. 
5. Play fair. This game is based partially on the honour system. So don't lock yourself up in your room for the next two weeks. Be a good sport. 

Please reply my e-mail and answer this question in order to receive the name of your target: What is the maximum number of "weapons" (pairs of socks) you can carry at any given time? 

Thanks for reading. Let the paranoia begin. :)
