Hola folks!

So...TONIGHT is dinner at Lao Sze Chuan! Logistics:

Dalit will lead a group over to the restaurant at 5:50 (meet just inside the doors to ISRC).

If you miss the group for whatever reason, you can just meet us at the restaurant.

It's super close to campus at:

1633 Orrington Ave
Evanston, IL 60201

See ya then!!
