Hello faculty, graduate and undergraduate students,

 

Are you interested in getting free feedback and usability testing on your personal webpages, research group pages, or other websites?  The Delta Lab is conducting a study that involves crowdsourcing visual hierarchy and alignment feedback from users and weâ€™re looking for websites to use for testing purposes.  

 

At the end of our study you will receive the usability reports on visual hierarchy and alignment that we collect.  There will also be a short follow-up survey to hear your opinion on the quality of feedback received.

 

Sign up to receive usability feedback on your site

 

Thanks!
