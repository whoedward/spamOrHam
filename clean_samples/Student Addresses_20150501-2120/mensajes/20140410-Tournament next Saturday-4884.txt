Hey all!
 
We'll be going to the Chicago Open Taekwondo Championship Saturday, April 19th, a quick 45 min drive away. Even if you're not competing, I encourage you to come and spectate. If you've never been to a tournament before, this will be a great chance to see one and watch some very high-level Taekwondo sparring matches. Admission for spectators will be $10 at the door.
 
You can register to compete here.
 
In order to rent the van(s) I need to know how many of you will come, whether to compete or spectate. If you're coming, please let me know by this (Thursday) evening by 8pm!
 
We'll leave sometime Saturday morning and get back in the evening.
 
Cheers,
Andrew
