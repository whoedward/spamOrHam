Thanks for letting us know!  If you can't make the meeting, we totally understand.  What we will do is get all your shifts tomorrow covered just in case and, if you feel up to it, you can email the tech and let them know you can come in.  If not, just stay home and rest.

Feel better!

    Hello.

    I have released these on shift planning, but I will need this Thursday (tomorrow) from 6PM to 8PM covered and the following Thursday from 2PM until 4PM covered.

    I probably will not be able to come to tonight’s meeting. I have been running a fever of 103 and have nausea. I haven’t left my dorm in 3 days.

    Hopefully I feel better and can come, but no promises.

    Also, if my symptoms persist through Thursday, I will not be able to work my other Thursday shifts. How should I handle this?

    Thanks!
