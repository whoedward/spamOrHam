Hey everyone,

Just wanted to send out a reminder about tonight's designer pow-wow at 10:30 in the Big 10 Room. All designers are required to be there, but anyone and everyone who wants to come and sit in is welcome! See y'all then.

All the best,
Matt

November 10 @ 10:30 pm in Norris Big Ten Room (104) - This is a mandatory (but fun!) meeting for all designers to share thoughts, visions and mostly to get on the same page artistically. All are welcome to attend, but for lead designers this is a must. Please email me if there are any concerns/problems with this time.

We will all meet each other and kick off this production process and it will be awesome. This will also be PRELIMINARY DESIGN PRESENTATIONS, so be prepared with inspiration and initial ideas!
