Hi,

I am Aaron from Northwestern University's student-run company BoxCo., a member of the Northwestern Student Holdings.

We are currently hiring students for our spring operations, and would love to extend this opportunity to your athletic club. Their primary job will be to lift and arrange heavy boxes, and they will receive $12 to $15 per hour in compensation, among other perks.
I would really appreciate if you could convey this offer to the team, and forward it to any relevant people. If there are any questions or clarifications about this position, feel free to reach out to me!

For more information about BoxCo., and for the application, you may visit the site http://www.nuboxco.com/

I look forward to hearing from you!

Aaron Loh
Northwestern University
BoxCo. Analyst
