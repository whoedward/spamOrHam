Got a referral from Magan. I think our CareerCat liting is gone now, I guess we are officially not hiring anymore.

Hi Will,

My name is Yousuf Kadir and I am a Freshman at NU. I was given your contact information by Magan Omar. I am a work study student and I am interested in working Norris Tech. Magan told me that you guys were hiring, but I couldn't find anything on CareerCat so I thought I'd send you an email. 

I am pretty familiar with audio and visual equipment (speakers and projectors), so setting up any equipment shouldn't be difficult for me to figure out. 

Please let me know if there are any positions available. 

Thanks.

Yousuf Kadir
