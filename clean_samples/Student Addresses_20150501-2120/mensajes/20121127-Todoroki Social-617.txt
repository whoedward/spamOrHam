Hey everyone, Hope your week is going well,

Want free sushi?

Next Monday December 3rd at 5:30 ISRC will be going on the Reading Week Unlimited Sushi Social to Todoroki in downtown Evanston with our Master, Alec Klein! I will be taking 20 people, slots will be allocated as follows:

7 slots will be released Wednesday the 28th at 1pm, just respond to the email I send out on that day as quickly as possible.
7 more slots will be released Friday the 30th at 1pm, just respond to the email I send out on that day as quickly as possible. 
Finally 6 slots will be picked from a pool at random. (Ie if you can't email me or don't email me quickly enough, email me to put your name on the lottery list and I will pick 6 names at random to go to the social on Friday at 6pm)

If you have any questions feel free to ask. 

Good luck on your finals and papers,

Anthony
