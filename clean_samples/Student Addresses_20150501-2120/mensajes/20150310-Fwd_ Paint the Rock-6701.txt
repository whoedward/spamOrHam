One simply doesn’t paint the rock.

One must guard it for 24 hours before painting it.

 

That’s it.

 

The space only needs to be reserved if there’s going to be an event held in the surrounding location.

Hi Dan, 

 

My roommates (to include Mike McCauley) and I are trying to figure out how to reserve the rock to paint. We figured that you might have some guidance for us in that respect. With that in mind, how does one reserve the rock?

 

Best,
