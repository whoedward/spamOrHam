Hi Barbara,

I think that we set things up so that a post is made on the Facebook page when you Tweet (but not the other way around). But you can always set it up so that you tweet when you post. See this link: https://www.facebook.com/twitter/

Hope that helps!

Ethan

    Hi Ethan; lying awake last night feeling frustrated that I didn't think of posting the EWG Clean 15 and Dirty Dozen lists for my first FB page, ESP  since it was sitting right on my desk :(
    I will attempt it later but then couldn't remember if we set up Twitter to link to that page (or will I need to do them separately?)
