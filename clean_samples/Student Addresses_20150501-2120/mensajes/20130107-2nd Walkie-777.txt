Hey NTS,

Does anyone know where the 2nd walkie is? We currently have 1 walkie between two techs because the second one is nowhere to be found. If you know of its whereabouts, please respond ASAP.  

Remember, although it is recommended to stay on shift until the tech after you arrives, if you absolutely cannot stay, please keep your keys/walkie in the hollow so that the next tech can easily find it. 

Best,
