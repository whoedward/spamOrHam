Hello supervisors.

Sorry for the late notice but I have reached that time of the quarter where project meetings and group meetings are too frequent at night. Unity meetings are now Wednesdays at the same time as the nts meeting so I cannot make it the next two weeks.

Let me know if there are any issues. Thanks.
