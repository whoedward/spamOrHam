Hi Everyone, 

Can someone please cover my Sunday 4pm-6pm this weekend? I need to attend a performance that's required for me to be able to write an essay that is worth a large part of my grade in my Music History class, so I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. I would be willing to swap shifts if you need something covered. Thanks!
