Hi Everyone,

As I mentioned at Open Exec today, Exec is working on updating the bulletin board in our dinning section in Hinman. What I need from you all is to send me photos of you and other ISRCers showing off your ISRC spirit. Wear your shirts, have pineapple, take a selfie with a fellow, be as creative as possible!! The best photos will be put on the board. 

Please email me your photos by October 15th!


Have an amazing week everyone. 

ISRCLove,
Esteban
