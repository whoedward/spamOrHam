Hello Fairchildren,


Last call on tickets to go see this modern adaptation of Julius Caesar at the sweet Chicago Shakespeare Theater at a seriously subsidized price!


Friday, Feb 8,  Julius Caesar at Chicago Shakespeare Theater at Navy Pier, 6 – 10:30 PM

Subsidized price: $10


If you haven't been to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater at Navy Pier, you have to go. The inside is modeled after The Globe Theater, and it's gorgeous. And what better play to see there than this contemporary adaptation of Julius Caesar? Acclaimed British director Jonathan Munby, whose work has graced the stages of the Royal Shakespeare Company and Shakespeare's Globe, uses the fractured political landscape of present-day Washington as a backdrop—drawing current events into eerily sharp focus. When men feel they can no longer trust their elected leader and when financial might dictates the rules of the game, where is the line between patriotism and personal ambition?


If you are interested in going on these trips, here is what you should do!

    Read the Cross-College ticket policy attached and make sure that  you understand and accept the policy (the payment part will be applicable for future events)
    Email me by this SATURDAY (the 26th) if you want to go on either trip. I will let you know if there are tickets still available. If you want to go to the dinner, tell me your entree preference
    Give me the money to reserve your spot no later than Monday, January 28th (under my door in a sealed envelope with your name or in person).
    If you have *any* questions, send me an email whenever and I will answer them. My email address is cb228@u.northwestern.edu
    Wait for an email from Nancy Anderson with further details. 

Best,

Cheryl
