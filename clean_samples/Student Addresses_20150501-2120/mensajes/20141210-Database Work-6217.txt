Hi Judy!

I've been going through my "inbox" of projects, and just wanted to follow up with you on the brief chat that we had the other day about databases. If you're still interested in talking with me, or in more information, I'd love to correspond about it.

Oh, and no rush, by the way; take your time.

Best,
