Hi ISRC!

I have attached the sign-up sheet for cooking times. There are times Friday night, all day Saturday, and most of the day on Sunday. 

When it's your turn to cook, you'll come down to the ISRC library, pick up your ingredients and anything else you need to cook, and head off to make your dish. 

If you are a non-res or are cooking outside of ISRC, you may pick up your ingredients anytime starting Friday night.
