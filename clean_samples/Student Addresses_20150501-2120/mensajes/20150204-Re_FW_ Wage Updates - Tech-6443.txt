    Hello NTS Supervisors,

    See the wage updates, attached.  Please discuss at your meeting tonight, and moving forward, do your best to limit hours for those who are running low on their work study allotment.  In the near future, we should have a conversation on potential new hires.

     

    Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

    Hello!

     

    Here is a current wage update with the estimated hours your student employees can work before they run out of their allotment. If they are getting low, please make a regular wage request ASAP! Students listed in gray are still missing their Work Study Authorization Forms. And lastly, please let me know if anyone is missing from this list so we can figure out what is going on.

     

    Thanks!

    Jenn
