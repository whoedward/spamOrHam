Hey guys!

Just a reminder that we're having dinner and a board game social tonight!  Join us at 5:30 at Thai Sookdee for dinner, and then my place, 2531 Jackson Ave. (Next to Ryan Field) for board games afterwards!  Even if you can only make one, you're welcome to join us!  If you come to dinner though, you can probably get a ride up to my place =p

My cell is 618-316-3961 if anyone wants to reach me.

Allan
