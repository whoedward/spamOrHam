The Residential College Board cordially invites you to...

RESTalks
Inspired by the popular organization, TED, which promotes "ideas worth sharing," we have invited four of RCB's very own faculty fellows to give brief, interesting, widely accessible talks on topics that are of particular relevance to college students. 

Saturday, November 9th
3:00 - 4:30
Swift Hall Room 107

Stay up to date as our four speakers are revealed over the facebook event!
