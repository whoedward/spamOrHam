Hi ISRC!

Our big philanthropy event this quarter is Relay for Life. I want to get a feel for how many people will be on the ISRC team, so if you are interested in participating, please email me!

When: May 16-17 6pm-6am (but you're not locked in)
Where: SPAC
What: The team walks around a track, eats free food, and plays fun games all night to raise money for the American Cancer Society

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,

Ellen
