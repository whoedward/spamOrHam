Hey all!

So this is the last ASG related email you're going to receive from me as your senator.

I hope every one of you has had a fantastic year with many more ups than downs. I've loved getting to know some of you and I'm sure in the future I'll continue to meet you long after I'm done sending these stupid emails. Good luck to those of you leaving us and I look forward to seeing most of you back here in the fall. 

To end with a quote, 
"I'd like to say RIP to this stage because I'm killin' it right now." -2Chainz.

Good luck for finals and have a fantastic summer,
Swiatek

Attend the State of Inclusion Address

Join us as we invite members of the Diversity Leaders' Group to a moderated-panel discussion on the University's current and future efforts towards making Northwestern a more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming institution for all of its students. After introductions and initial questions, the floor will be open to Q&A for the audience. Most of the University's key stakeholders of Diversity a& Inclusion will be in the same room! This is your chance to ask anything you want while addressing most of the University's key stakeholders of Diversity & Inclusion efforts who will all be in the same room.

The event will be held on Friday June 6 at 1:00 p.m. in Fisk 217. We hope to see you there! Please email asg-diversity@u.northwestern.edu with any questions. 

Join the CTEC Working Group

Do you think the CTEC system is outdated? unattractive? confusing? or just ineffective? You aren't alone. ASG's Academic Committee is looking for undergraduates interested in serving on faculty/student working groups that will analyze the CTEC experience and make a proposal to the university's CTEC committee.

Groups will meet once this quarter and several times in the fall. Please email asg-academic@u.northwestern.edu with questions or to express interest.

Find Work on JobCat!

JobCat connects busy Evanston residents with Northwestern students who want to help. From babysitting to administrative work, JobCat is a great way to get involved in the Evanston community and make some money in the process.
