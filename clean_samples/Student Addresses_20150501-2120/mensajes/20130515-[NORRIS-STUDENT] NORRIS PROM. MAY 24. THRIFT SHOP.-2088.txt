Newbies: What is Norris Prom? Only the best day of the year. We all dress up in our classiest/tackiest duds, eat free grub at Norris, and dance the night away. This year's theme is Thrift Shop, so I expect to see some great outfits. Plus, there will be prizes. Best Dressed, Most Creative, Shiniest Costume, etc. Bring a date, bring a friend, roll solo, and get ready for a FUN-tastic night with all your Norris friends to celebrate the end of the year. That's what Norris Prom is all about.

"It's fun!"- Steph Marshall
"I can't wait! Norris bonding! Make sure there's more than one exclamation mark!!!"- Harlynn Siler
