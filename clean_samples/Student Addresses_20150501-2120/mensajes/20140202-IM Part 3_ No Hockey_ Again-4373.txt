THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS PLAYED

I'M SO PROUD OF OUR TEAMS

WE'RE #1 ON THE FIELD AND IN MY HEART

Important things:

I am so excited to introduce Spencer Martens to you all. He agreed to join us as a free agent. He will be playing basketball with us! Thank you and welcome to the isrc fam Spencer!

Basketball on Super Bowl Sunday!!! At 4 PM. Meet in the lobby at 3:45- Spencer we can meet you at Blom! We should be done by 4:45, the Super Bowl starts at 5:30 CT so we should be good on that account.

We are playing PARC this week - I got a good feeling about this you guys!

No Hockey- again. Postponed for Super Bowl. Tune in next week.

Make sure to bring your WILDCards! They need to check to make sure you're on the roster. I added everyone that played last week as well as people that said they were interested.

Thanks so much

Much love

PK
