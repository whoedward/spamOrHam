Hey everyone!

As I had mentioned in the meeting, the liaison program is going to continue.  In the process of going through old documents, I have found a few other student groups that we are going to be contacting.  Please update the spreadsheet with any relevant information as I want to send this out to student group leaders ASAP! (Green are new potential contacts)

Also, double check the spreadsheet to see if you have any new groups, I had to add a few people so that all the groups were covered.  Here is a final sheet of the groups everyone is assigned.

Action Items 

    Send an email to your group contact (some have been updated) saying hi and introducing yourself if not done already and getting relevant contact info
    If you have done that, ask what events they are planning for the winter quarter!  (we want dates and brief description of each event)


Once all that information is compiled then I will be composing a sample of the email blasts that MSAB will be putting out for next quarter!

Also, the website team is still looking for potential people to contact in regards to putting blurbs on the website about their majors and programs so if you know anyone (they donâ€™t have to commit or anything) that would be okay being contacted please add them to this list here.

Let me know if you guys have any questions!!  Have a nice week!

Jason
