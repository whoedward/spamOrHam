Hey y'all,

Here is some important stuff we went over at the meeting today...

The time has come to PUBLICIZE our INDIEGOGO link on your Facebook page, seriously I'll badger you if I don't see status start to go up in the next few days!
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/soul-conductor-vertigo-s-fall-play

Sign up for 2 hours of build this weekend and remember, ALL HANDS ON DECK for LOAD IN starting at 3:00 pm. Everyone has to be there.

Please let Michele know if you have any costume items on her spreadsheet. We ask that EVERYONE bring ONE CLOTHING ITEM to load in on Sunday, for the ghosts to use while they become spirits, it can be anything from a winter hat to a ball gown. I promise you will get anything you lend us back immediately after the show ends.

You are all incredible, I can't wait for this show to go up.
