Hi NTS, hope your reading week's been more productive than mine

Announcements

We will be sending out spring quarter availability soon, make sure to keep an eye out for that and get that in ASAP.

Spring Break shifts are available, if you can work during spring break please email Michael and we will get you scheduled.

Any Finals Week coverages need to be sent out over the listserv, the earlier the better. We are open all the way through Friday, so if you are planning to leave early, make sure you get your shifts covered
