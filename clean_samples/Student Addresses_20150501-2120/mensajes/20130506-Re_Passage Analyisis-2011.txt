    Hi Ethan,

    Can you send it as an attachment? I don't think I have a u.northwestern account.

    Thanks,

    Hello Professor Roberts,

    First, I want to apologize for the lateness. It turns out that 5:00 and 6:00 are pretty similar-looking when one is not paying close attention.
    If need be, I can print out the documents myself.
    Hopefully this will do, either way.

    Best,
    Ethan Robison
