Hey everybody,

Hope midterm season is going well!! I will be hosting a social to Greektown this Sunday, leaving the dorm at 11:40, getting back around 4pm. We will get lunch and walk around the neighborhood. For more info on Greektown, see: http://www.greektownchicago.org. The cost to take the metra into the city is $4.25 (which will not be subsidized). However, the metra fare back into Evanston will be subsidized, as well as a portion of the the meal (~$15 per person). I will be taking 12 people. Slots will be released like they were for the Giordano's social, but instead they will be released 6 at a time at 10AM on Wednesday October 24th and 10AM on Friday the 26th. Email me if you cannot reply to the emails at these times. 

Have a great Week! 

Anthony
