Hey ISRCers,

Just a reminder. Academic and Social Committee meeting at 8PM in the main lounge. After that, we are going to watch a German movie called "The Counterfeiter (Die FÃ¤lscher)" (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_counterfeiters_2007/). It is based on a true story about a Jewish forger who was coerced to assist Nazi operations during WW2. So come hangout with us and get thrilled ! See you all there !

Best,
Arkar
