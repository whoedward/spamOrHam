Hello,

Attached is our poster presentation.
Additionally, although this is a little late, I must inquire as to whether or not it is too late to have this printed. If it can still be done, would you kindly instruct me on how to do this?

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    Hello All,

    Two important things:
    1) There has been a hiccup with the plotter in the library, it is currently out-of-service. I know they're working on fixing it, expect an update later today. In light of this fact, the "extended" printing office hours scheduled today from 1-2p are canceled.

    2)
    I'm collecting everyone's posters, so we have them on file to project on the big screen during the awards ceremony.

    **Please have someone from your team email me your final poster file in .jpeg form, named like so:**

    SECTION#_TEAM#_LAST NAME
    Example: 6_2_schwartz.jpeg

    Please do this by noon on Friday, if I don't receive your poster, there will be nothing to show everyone if you win!
