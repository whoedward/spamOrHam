I can take it if it's still available.

    Hey guys,

    Can I get someone to cover my 10am-12pm shift this Sunday?  I'm not
    coming back into town until later that day, but I doubt there's going
    to be much going on so I would really appreciate it if someone could
    cover it for me.  As always, I'm willing to take one of your shifts if
    you want me to.

    Thanks,

    Will
