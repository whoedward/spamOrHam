Hi everyone, I hope your finals went well.

Please fill out this Google Doc by next Friday, March 28th so we can get started making the schedule for spring quarter.

Also, make sure that you have updated your availability on Shiftplanning - we will make the schedule based off the times you give us. As a reminder, make sure that you indicate the times you will be unavailable due to a scheduled conflict, such as class, meeting etc. Don't mark that you're unavailable during the weekends, mornings etc just because you don't want to work those shifts. We will do our best to make sure you get the shifts that you want.

Thanks,
