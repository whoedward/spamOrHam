Hullo, everyone.
  I am getting ready to leave for Spain pretty soon, so: Ethan and Mike, I'm going to give my mom your email addresses so that you can coordinate the delivery of my contributions (as listed in my prev. email.) Expect an email from her shortly.
  I hope you are all enjoying the summer vacay.

  P.S. Mike, I can't find you on Venmo. How am add?
