Hello ISRC,

Kyle and I have been discussing a joint Academic/Social trip. So far we have three ideas.

First we have a trip to Bronzeville. We would have lunch at Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles then go to the DuSable Museum of African-American History, which is free on Sundays. Bronzeville is on the Southside, which means there would be a long transportation time. However we could probably completely subsidize this trip for about 8 people.

Our second option is Pilsen. There is the National Museum of Mexican Art which always free and many Mexican-American restaurants to eat at. Again Pilsen is far south, so transportation time would be long. Again this could probably be completely subsidized.

Our third option is the Chicago Botanical Gardens in Glencoe. Again this is always free. We would take the Metra 30 minutes north. We could eat either in the gardens or a nearby restaurant.

Please let us know your interest in any of these option or if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,
Jonas and Kyle
