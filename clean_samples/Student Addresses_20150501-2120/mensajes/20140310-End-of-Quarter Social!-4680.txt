Hey all!

We're getting together for an end-of-quarter social this week. This will be a great occasion for us to spend some quality time together in a relaxed, non-Taekwondo setting. You should come if you like food, drinks, stories, games, and/or fun.

To figure out a time that'll work for all of us, fill out the Doodle form in the link below. Please indicate EVERY 3-hour block that works for you. If you can't make any of the times, also indicate that. This social is going to happen between Wednesday-Saturday of this week.

It's important that you fill out the form ASAP. Once a time and location is decided, I'll send out another announcement.
