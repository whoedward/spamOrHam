I'll do it! I already work 2-4, so I can take this shift from you no problem.

    Hi all, 

    I have to meet with my academic adviser tomorrow, could someone help me out for this shift?
    Wednesday 10/31 from 4 to 6pm please! I will love you forever! New techs can take this shift too because Phoebe is check listed! 

    Thanks,
    Andrew Jung
