Hey everyone, 

The end is near. The end of the quarter, that is. And possibly, the end of your metaphorical life. What do I mean? 

It's time for a dorm-wide game of Assassins! 

Assassins, also known as Spy vs. Spy, is an elimination game. Every participant is assigned a target to "kill" (hit with a pair of clean balled up socks) and must do so without being seen by any other resident of the dorm. If you successfully "kill" your target, he/she is eliminated and must give his/her target to you. You win if you are the last person left, or if you have the most kills before the end of the game. 

The game will most likely start next week and last until the end of reading week, with one or two rounds, depending on how many people are playing. 
The more the merrier, and I'm sure it will be a welcome distraction from studying and finals, even if it is caused by paranoia. Due-paying non-residents are also welcome to join. 

There will be a prize! 

Sign up: http://bit.ly/YX4iFX by 6pm this Saturday, March 2. 

I will send a complete list of rules, including restrictions and logistics, the day before the game starts.  

As always, e-mail me with any questions.

Hannah
