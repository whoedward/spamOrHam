Do you really know Northwestern's alcohol policy?

Like, really know it?

Don't you worry if not, because FELP is hosting an ALCOHOL FIRESIDE on Monday, June 3in Elder room 32 at 6:30! Come hang out with us and discuss:

    Really, what is the Responsible Action Protocol, though?
    Does it have our (i.e. students) best interests at heart?
    How can we work with the administration to improve our alcohol policy?

Student leaders and administrators working together to figure out a policy that best meets student needs will facilitate a thorough conversation with y'all. And we'll have FOOD!

We'll see you there!
