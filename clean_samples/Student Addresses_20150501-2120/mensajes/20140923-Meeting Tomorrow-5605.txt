Hi everyone,

Our first meeting of the year will be tomorrow, from 7-8pm, in the Wildcat Room. We will be talking about our plans for this year and some changes we'll be making, so please try to come if possible. This will also be the best opportunity for you to change your schedule or trade shifts if you need to.

If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by noon tomorrow with your reason.

Thanks,
