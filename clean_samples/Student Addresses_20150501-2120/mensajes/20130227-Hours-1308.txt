Hi Everyone, 

Really sorry for the late notice, but I just got word that I can get extra credit in one of my classes if I go to a concert on Saturday night and write about it. I DESPERATELY need extra credit in this class. If anyone could take my rotation on Saturday night (8pm-12am) I would really appreciate it!
