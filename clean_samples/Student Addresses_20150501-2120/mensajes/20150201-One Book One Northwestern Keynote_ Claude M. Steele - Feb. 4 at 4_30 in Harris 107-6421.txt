In Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do, eminent social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele explores the phenomenon of stereotype threat: what happens to us when we are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about our social group (of being a particular race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socio-economic status, religious identity, etc.) Reflecting on the research that he and his colleagues have conducted over the past four decades, Steele offers strategies for how to reduce its effects and thereby improve student performance and increase acceptance in a diverse society.

There will be a book signing following the keynote.
