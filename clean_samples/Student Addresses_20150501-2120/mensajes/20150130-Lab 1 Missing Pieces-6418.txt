Hi Professor Duggan,

I am Ethan Robison, a student in your 11:00 a.m. databases course. I am emailing you about my lab 1. I did not manage to correctly implement a few files in the first lab, and as such am in a bind with regards to the second.

Specifically, I had trouble with the HeapFile and SeqScan segments of the first lab, although only with two or three operators in HeapFile.

With that in mind, what can I do to get up to speed so that I can get started on lab 2 as quickly as possible?

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thank you in advance for any help,
