ASG dedicates Paul Friesema Day, debuts new services

Senate honors recently deceased professor, declares February 20 Paul Friesema Day
H. Paul Friesema, a professor emeritus of Politial Science, passed away on March 8th. ASG "recognizes February 20 (the professor's birthdate) as Paul Friesema Day, and encourages Northwestern University to do the same, in reflection of his life’s work on behalf of the natural environment and Native American cultures alike." The Senate also called on the University to dedicate a permanent memorial to the late professor.

ASG announces two newly redesigned services
In Senate on Wednesday, ASG launched the newly revamped BookSwap, which hosts student-to-student textbook sales. Cab Corner, an ASG-sponsored third-party application developed for Northwestern, allows students to arrange shared cab rides. The service is restricted to Northwestern members with NetID access.

BookSwap: A Virtual Marketplace For Your Books

BookSwap is back and better than ever!

BookSwap is a free and open to all Northwestern students with an active netID and password. Students using BookSwap can search for books by name or class and communicate directly with the seller on pricing and pickup. Additionally, students can post books they want to sell without any fees or shipping charges.

Check out BookSwap at bookswap.northwestern.edu for all your Spring Quarter class needs.

The dogs will be available to visit:

This Spring: Zumba Classes on South Campus!
	
	

Next quarter Zumba classes will be offered on South Campus.

Parkes Hall 122
April 4 - May 23rd

Classes will be taught by Megan Knee and will be similar to the same ones currently offered at SPAC.

Sponsored by NUFitRec and ASG. 

Four Years: A Book By the Class of 2013

We invite all seniors to participate in a new Northwestern tradition: a book of letters. This book will reflect upon who we’ve become in the last four years, and allow us to share that with one another and with the incoming class of 2017.

Here’s how it works: write a letter about your time at Northwestern to yourself four years ago or four years from now. Be specific in these letters -- stories, moments, highlights, lowlights-- they can be as long or as short as you want, sign them however you want (names not necessary). Get creative, but keep in mind it’ll run in black and white. E-mail your letter to fouryears@u.northwestern.edu by April 7th for selection and editing.

We plan to compile these letters into a bound book to distribute to seniors at the end of the year, as well as the incoming freshman as they arrive on campus. This is a way to commemorate your NU experience and provide advice to the new class. With any questions, e-mail fouryears@u.northwestern.edu.

 

10K Initiative: Vote Today!

This fall, ASG collected nearly 500 submissions from students telling us how they would spend $10,000 to improve the Northwestern community. We've narrowed it down to the top 4 ideas. Now, it's your turn to vote for the winner.

We have $10,000 to improve Northwestern. How do you want the money spent?

Cab Corner: NU's Cab Sharing Solution
	
	

ASG is pleased to announce the introduction of ‘Cab Corner,’ a cab sharing program for the exclusive of Northwestern students. The service will allow students to coordinate date, time and location of their destination and be matched with students traveling with similar itinerary.

The program will be hosted at nu.cabcorner.com. Once on the site students can either submit a request for a cab share or view postings to find one that match their needs. The program will be especially useful during the holidays when students can prearrange their transportation to and from the airport.

Campus Voice: Your Voice is Our Vision

Have you checked out Campus Voice yet? Using this online forum, students are able to express themselves by submitting ideas, problems, or questions about Northwestern student life! Giving ASG and the administration feedback about your concerns has never been easier!

Once you log in with their NetID, you will be able to make suggestions for campus improvements. Other students can then vote and comment on your ideas.

ASG representatives will explore every suggestion. We will then track each project’s progress on the website, keeping you informed every step along the way.

Visit campusvoice.northwestern.edu and start posting today!
