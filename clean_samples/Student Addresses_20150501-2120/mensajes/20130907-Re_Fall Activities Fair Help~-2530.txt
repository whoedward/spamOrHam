Sorry guys, but I forgot to briefly mention that this event will last from 12:30 P.M. to a little past 5:00 P.M. The sign-up sheet is divided into 30-minute intervals. Also, it would be especially great if some people can come at 12:30 P.M. to help set up and get registered. Thanks again.

    Hey, guys,

    So the Fall activities fair is right around the corner on the 22nd (Sunday) of this month. I imagine a lot of new students to be going around signing up for different activities, and I'd like for us to try to reach out to as many of them as possible. With that said, we would very much appreciate it if you guys could come and help us out at our station, even if it's for just a short amount of time. We'll just be talking to students, possibly holding out paddles for them to kick, and keeping each other company. I attached a sign-up sheet to this email, so please sign up for any time that you guys would be free and willing to help out on that day. Thank you guys in advance.

    Always yours,
    Davin
