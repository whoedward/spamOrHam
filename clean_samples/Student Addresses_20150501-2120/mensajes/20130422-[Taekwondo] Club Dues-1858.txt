Hi everyone,

It's about that time of the quarter again where I have to ask you all to pay club dues.  Unfortunately, due to the drop in membership last quarter, we actually took a significant loss in regards to finances.  Thus I have to increase dues for this quarter to $40.  Dues will be due by Saturday, May 11th by either cash or check.

Most of you have already heard this already, but for anyone who hasn't I'll say it again.  The dues that we collect help pay for the instruction that we get.  Even with the increases, it's really quite a good deal, considering that going yourself to a typical taekwondo academy even only once a week would typically cost around a hundred dollars a month, or $25 an hour.  At $40 for 9 weeks of professional taekwondo instruction, you're still paying less than $2 an hour for your TKD instruction.  AND of course, you get to hang out with us.  The cool people.

Once again, I'd like to mention that we do not want anyone's financial situation getting in the way of being able to learn taekwondo.  If you are in a situation where paying dues would be a burden, please come talk to me.  If you are only planning or able to make it to some practices, (ie. once a week), please come talk to me.  We can work something out.  Anything we discuss will be treated as confidential.

Please make any checks out to Northwestern University.  Do NOT make them out to Northwestern Taekwondo Club.  Otherwise we might not be able to process your payment.  And that would make me sad, and you don't want to make me sad right?  =(

If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to let me know!

Your treasurer,

Allan Dong
