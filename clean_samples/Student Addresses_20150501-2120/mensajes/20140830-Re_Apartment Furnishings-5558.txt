Linda,

It's good to hear from you. Though we cannot speak with utmost certainty, there are no forseeable events that would prevent our presence in the apartment on the date of September 27th. We will gladly help you move Jonas's things into the apartment.

If you have any further questions, please let us know.

Until then,
Ethan & Co,

    Mike and Ethan,

    As Jonas has committed to supply furniture (bookshelves, chair, couch) and kitchen necessities (dishes, microwave) for the apartment, his dad and I are hoping to make a delivery September 27th. We would also like to deliver items for his bedroom. Before renting a U-Haul and purchasing Megabus tickets for the trip home, we want to be sure someone is around and you're okay with the plan. Please let us know if this works for you also. As the date approaches, we can arrange a delivery time.

    Looking forward to hearing from you.

    Linda Carlsson
