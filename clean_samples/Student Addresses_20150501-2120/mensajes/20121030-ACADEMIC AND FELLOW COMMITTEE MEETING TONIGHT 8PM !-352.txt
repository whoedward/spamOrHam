Hey guys,

Come to the meeting tonight at 8PM in the main lounge to hear more about our future events we've planned. 

For our Halloween Special IFN at 8PM tomorrow night, we are going to watch Let the Right One In (Låt den rätte komma in). It is a Swedish horror film about a bullied boy who developed a relationship with a vampire girl. Also, there will be a lot of candies ! 

Best,
Arkar
