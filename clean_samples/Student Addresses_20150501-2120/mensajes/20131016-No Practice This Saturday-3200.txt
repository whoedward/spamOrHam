Hey, guys,

There is a football game this upcoming Saturday (10/19), so Blomquist will unfortunately be closed. That means that there won't be practice that day. With that said, go enjoy the day and cheer on the 'Cats.

I also wish the best to all those who are going to the Iowa State Tournament this weekend.

Yours,
Davin
