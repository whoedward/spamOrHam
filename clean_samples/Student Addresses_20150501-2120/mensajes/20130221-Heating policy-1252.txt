> This year, the ASG Sustainability Committee has worked to evaluate the heating policy on campus. Although a policy exists, many buildings seem to be hotter than the stated temperature, making buildings more uncomfortable and wasting energy. Extensive talks with Facilities Management and Residential Services have shown that the only way to correct this error is through student support. As part of our research collection, we will be sending out a survey to collect student complaints about academic and residential buildings. This information will help us illustrate student support and put together a proposal to address this issue.
