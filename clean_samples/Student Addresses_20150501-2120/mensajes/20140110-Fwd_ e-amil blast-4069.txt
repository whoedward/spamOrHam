Hello all,

Are you interested in learning a martial art but never had the chance? This Quarter the Tae Kwon Do club is holding special beginner practices to introduce people to the art. This Saturday, January 11th and next Saturday, January 18th from Noon to 2pm in Bloomquist the Black Belts of the club will be leading these classes. We will provide an overview of all the aspects of Tae Kwon Do, from the cardio and kicking used in Olympic Sparring to the stances, blocks, and strikes of the traditional forms to effective self-defense techniques.

During the week, the Tae Kwon Do club holds practices for beginners from 8pm to 9pm in Bloomquist on Mondays and Wednesdays. If you cannot make the special beginner classes on Saturday, you are more than welcome to join during weekday classes. More information about the club can be found on our website.

I hope to train will you all soon.

Eric Gilson
2nd Dan Black Belt
