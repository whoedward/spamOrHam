Hello everyone,

I am Sean McGinnis and I am going to be running BJJ practices Wednesdays at 8 over at blomquist, starting tomorrow.
I hope everyone that wants to go can make it, we will be reviewing the Triangle Choke from guard, and then I will teach everyone my favorite submission, the Triangle Choke from mount.

Hope to see you there,
Sean

    Hello!

    The first practice of the quarter will be this Saturday at Blomquist 2-4pm. 
    We're going to review some basic concepts and learn some attacks from the back.
    We will also be discussing a possible mid-week practice and t-shirts.

    Hope to see you all there!
    Jacob
