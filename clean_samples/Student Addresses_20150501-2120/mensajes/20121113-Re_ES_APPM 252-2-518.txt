    Hello,
    You are receiving this email because you are currently enrolled in honors calc (ES_APPM 252-1).  If you plan to continue with ES_APPM 252-2 next quarter, you will need a permission number.  You should send me an email that includes your emplID number (7 digit number beginning with "2") and request a code.

    Note: Even with the permission number, you will need to wait until your registration time begins to enroll in honors calc 2.
