Hi everyone,

I have been getting a lot of questions about what files you need to submit for the Lab Project. You should copy paste your function in a .txt file (as the provided template for each lab project). Include only the functions that are presented in the template .txt file and answer the questions.

Do not submit .m files. Do not submit Word files either. Just a simple .txt file with all your functions and your answers pasted into it.

Best,

Leonidas
