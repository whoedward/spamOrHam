Hey guys,

I know there's a meeting tomorrow (is there?) but uhhh it would be great if I could be excused from this meeting because it's my brother's last night of visiting! I would like to take him out to some deep dish Chicago style pizza. 

Thanks~~~ Please let me know how it goes!

Phoebe

P.S. It'd be great if I could have this Friday rotation :)
