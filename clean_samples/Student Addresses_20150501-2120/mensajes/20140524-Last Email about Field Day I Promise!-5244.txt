Good  morning ISRC!

Do you know what today is?!?! FIELD DAY!!!

Here is some important information for today:
-If you signed up for an event, meet in the Main Lounge at 12:15pm to go over some rules. 
-For everyone else, I will be leading a group over to the Lakefill at 12:40pm. We will sign in, and grab some delicious food. 
-There is a whole bunch of events from 1-5, including non competitive ones like a bounce house. Help fill in for our team if the people who signed-up can't make it, or cheer from the crowd and bring ISRC Spirit. 
-At 2:15pm, we will be doing our Master's Mile. This is where we push our Master, Alec, in a shopping cart around a track. The RC with the fastest time wins! There were no sign ups for this event, so please join if you can. 
-Lastly, at the end of the day there will be an awards ceremony. 

Let's win some trophies! 

ISRCLove, 

Esteban
