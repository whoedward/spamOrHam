Mitsuwa social people, I have receipts from:

- Chang Tang
- Monika Hur
- Anthony Settipani
- Will Garrison
- Connie Wang
- Christina Chan
- Thomas Lee
- Jennifer Li
- Anthony Angueira
- Flora Sun
- Julie Lee

If you are NOT on this list and you want to get reimbursed, give me your receipts before 7 p.m. TODAY. Slide them under my door if necessary. Please don't be the person who holds up everyone else's reimbursements because you were too lazy to turn in yours, because then all of those people on the list will have open permission to beat you with sticks and pebbles. That would just be a dumb way to die.

    If you went to Mitsuwa yesterday and didn't give your receipts to Anthony, hand them in to me by MONDAY, Nov. 26th so I can try to turn them in before leaving for Thanksgiving!

    Your options are:
    1. Give them to me at Open Exec tonight (and earn yourself half an open exec point, yay!)
    2. Stop by 113 and hand them to me
    3. Stop by 113 and slide them under the door if I'm not around.

    Put your FULL NAME at the top so I know who to reimburse!!

    Also, I made this colorful because I know college kids have inexplicably short attention spans.
