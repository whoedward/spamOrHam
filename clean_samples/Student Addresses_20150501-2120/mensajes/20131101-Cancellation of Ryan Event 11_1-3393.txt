Hey NTS!

The Ryan event "Dance World" has been cancelled for tomorrow 11/2.  This means that Joyce, Kara, and Juan will no longer have to work tomorrow.  Thank you very much for stepping up though!

There is still a Chinese Student and Scholar Association presentation from 12:30 until 5:00.  Aliyah will meet the Satellite Venues people at the info desk at noon and walk to Ryan together.  Please train them in how a Ryan shift goes.Max Z. will come to Ryan at 1 PM.   At 3:30, Max G. will take over and finish the event.

Don't forget that tomorrow is training at Northwestern Room at 9 AM; see some of you there!  Have a good weekend!
