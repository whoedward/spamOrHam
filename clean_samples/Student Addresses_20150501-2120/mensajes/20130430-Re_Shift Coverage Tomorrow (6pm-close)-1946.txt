        Hey guys,

        Can anyone pick up this shift for me tomorrow? I would really appreciate it and will return the favor, schedule permitting. It's a great shift and I work with awesome people (s/o to Aliyah and John) if you needed any incentive in addition to the extra $$$.

        Thanks,

        Fadhi
