    Hi Supervisors,

    I'm sorry, but I won't be able to make the meeting tonight. I have class until 7:20, and immediately have to go to the ASG senate funding meeting right after. 

    Also, I need my Sunday 10-4pm shift covered. I won't be here, I'll be participating in annual competition. I know this is the day after Dillo, but PLEASE help me get it covered!!! Whoever does I will love them forever and ever. And I will owe them BIG TIME. Please communicate that to the others. I will be in serious debt to whoever can cover this. 

    Thanks!

    -Magan
