I can provide the tools (thrice over, really).

I am a fan of a slush fund for purchasing those necessary items, especially since I won't have to bring the trailer out if we don't have to bring a couch.

I get paid tomorrow, so if you just send me your info (I am a Nigerian prince...), I can do that for you.

As for the rest of you, I am sure that you are on board, yes?

Best,
Ethan
