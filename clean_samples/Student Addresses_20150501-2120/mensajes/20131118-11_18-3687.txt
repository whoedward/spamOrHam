Hey, guys,

First off, a huge shout out to all those who competed and supported us at the tournament. Personally, it was a great opportunity to gain a new perspective on the art and a time to really just get to know others in this club more. So once again, thanks to all those who came along.

Secondly, I just wanted to remind you guys that we do have practice at 8 P.M. today :)

Enjoy the start of a new week. Almost done with the quarter guys~
