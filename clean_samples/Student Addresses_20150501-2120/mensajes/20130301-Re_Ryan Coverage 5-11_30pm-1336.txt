        Hi NTS,

        We actually need an extra tech on the Ryan event the entire day, so we need 2 people there from 12pm-11:30pm. If you can take any part of the shift, please replay to this email ASAP.

        Thanks,

        Alex

            The client for the Ryan Event today wants another tech on shift during the actual event, so we need someone else on shift from 5-11:30pm.

            If you can take any part of the shift, please reply to this email.

            Thanks,

            Alex
