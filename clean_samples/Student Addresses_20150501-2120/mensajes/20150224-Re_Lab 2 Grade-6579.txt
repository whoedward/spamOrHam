Professor,

Thanks for the help! Now that I've looked at those posts (and also my grade), I realize that I need to do something about the results. 

With that in mind, is it still too late to fix things? I realize that running on my local machine is no excuse for not running elsewhere, but I passed all but one test and would really like to get a better grade if possible.

That said, I'm having a slew of problems and am not really sure where I should begin to fix things. Could I make an appointment to meet with you individually to fix things?

Best,
Ethan Robison

        Hi Professor,

        I am a student in your 11 a.m. databases course.
        As of yet, I have not received a grade for lab 2. I just wanted to check to make sure that it was submitted and received, and that you don't need anything additional from me. Please let me know if you do and I will fix it immediately!

        Best,
