Dear Ethan Robison:

We are pleased that you accepted the Audio/Visual Technician position, and you must now complete all paperwork before working any paid shifts.  Any hours you work prior to turning in paperwork and being cleared by the Student Employment Coordinator will be considered volunteer time.

All required forms and I-9 instructions are listed online at http://www.norris.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/NewEmployeePacket2011-12.pdf .  You may download and print the forms yourself, or you can pick up a paperwork packet in the 3rd floor Administration Office at Norris.

Once you complete all paperwork, please return to the Student Employment Coordinator in the 3rd floor administration offices at Norris (open M-F 9-5pm).  If you are required to complete the I-9, you must also bring ORIGINAL forms of I.D. as outlined on the above website and page 5 of the I-9 form.  Copies and faxes will NOT be accepted, and you cannot work any paid shifts until this form is complete with documentation.

If you have any questions, problems with the paperwork, or would like to pick up hard copies of the forms, feel free to contact or visit me on the 3rd floor.  

Comments from Supervisor:
Please turn in the paperwork included in the New Employee Packet as soon as possible.

Thanks, and welcome to Norris!

Sincerely,

Jennifer Stripe
Student Employment Coordinator
