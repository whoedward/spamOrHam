Hi NTS,

Sorry to keep spamming the listserv, but we still have some people who haven't filled out their spring schedules out yet.

Here's the link again

I put in some extra blank sheets in case you aren't able to access your personal one, just make sure to put your name on the tab once you're done.

Please get it filled out ASAP, otherwise I'll have to skip over people when I'm scheduling and that just makes it messier to fix later.

I hope to have a schedule out by midnight so we can hammer out anything problems before we get back to campus.

Thanks,

Alex
