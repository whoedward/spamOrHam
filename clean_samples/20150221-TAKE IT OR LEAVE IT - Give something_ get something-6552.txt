Hello ISRC!

Below is a blurb about Take It Or Leave it. Make sure to put any clothes you want to donate in the box near the main stairwell of ISRC!

Take It Or Leave It
Thursday, February 26, 12-4pm, Norris, Northwestern Room

Wildcats! Going through your closet and wanting something new for spring? Join the Take It or Leave It program and start putting your items in the box provided by your Eco-Rep! On February 26, come out to the Northwestern Room from 12-4 pm at Norris to see what treasure you can reap! By doing so, you are helping to divert the 900,000 items of clothing that go to the landfill every year. One wildcat's trash will be another wildcat's treasure!
