Hi EA1 Students,
As you are probably aware, midterm 1 is coming up soon (on Thursday, to be precise). The midterm will begin at 7:00 pm and should take about 1.5 hours to complete. Here are the rooms you will go to:

Section 20 (Freeman 9am): LR2
Section 21 (Freeman 10am): LR2
Section 22 (Nocedal 11am): LR3
Section 23 (Nguyen 12pm): LR3

In case you are not familiar with the LR rooms, they are the big rooms on either side of Ryan Auditorium in the lobby of Tech.

Best of luck preparing for the midterm!
