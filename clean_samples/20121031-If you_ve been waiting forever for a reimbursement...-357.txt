I'm going to have to ask you to wait a little longer.

I am so, so, so sorry guys. I don't know what's going on, but the last few weeks at the Cashier's Office has been either... they've run out of cash, or Dominique (the only person authorized to give out petty cash) is out for the entire week, or they've run out of cash again. She said that the earliest they might have money is Friday, but I'll be out of town this weekend, unfortunately.

Thank you all for being patient. If you're wondering where your money is... that's what happened. But I will get it back to you, I promise, and hopefully by next week. Again, I don't know what's going on. This is the first time I've run into so many problems getting money back, so hopefully it'll also be the last.

Happy Halloween!
