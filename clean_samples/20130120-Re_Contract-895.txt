    Good Morning, Dean Holtgreive,

     

    Attached is a copy of the contract signed by my team members, myself, and our client. I could not find relevant upload options on Blackboard, so I am sending it your way. If this is not useful, or you need the copy placed somewhere else, then please ignore the picture and provide the appropriate direction. Thank you very much for your time.

     

    As always,

    Ethan Robison
