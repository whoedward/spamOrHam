Hey ISRC,

If you signed up for the Stock Market Competition, here is an update about the competition.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you to everyone who signed up for the stock market competition. We truly appreciate your interest and participation. The competition is well under way and it looks like many of you have already started investing (and those who haven't started investing yet should start)!

This is just a reminder that if you are part of the competition and haven't done so already, you should fill out your contact information using the form. If your contact information is not filled out by the end of the competition, you will be disqualified. Fortunately, there is a lot of time left until the end of the competition, so all you have to do is fill out the form and start investing! Here is the link to the form.

Again, thank you so much for participating. And don't hesitate to email me at jinsolkang2017@u.northwestern.edu if you have any questions or concerns.

Happy investing!
