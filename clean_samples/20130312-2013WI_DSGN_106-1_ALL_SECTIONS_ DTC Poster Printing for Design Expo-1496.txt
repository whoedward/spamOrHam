Hello All,
Hopefully projects are going well. Quick reminder that posters can be printed at any time in the *Main* library. Printing at the library will cost about $10.00, and teams are expected to pay for it themselves. The plotter is located in the main computer room just past the library entrance.

Office hours this week (Tu 5-7p, Wed 3-4p) will be held in the library. I'll be sitting near the reference desk with a sign, ready to help you through poster printing.
Additionally, I'll be here this Thursday 3/14 from 1-2p if you can't make the other times.

If you'd like to try to print your posters independently, a walkthrough of plotter setup is located here: http://libguides.northwestern.edu/content.php?pid=59115&;sid=438793
(Note: For optimum results, you should size your poster slide in powerpoint to 36"H X 24"W).

If you have any other questions, as always feel free to email me at samuelschwartz2012@u.northwestern.edu.

Best,
-Sam
