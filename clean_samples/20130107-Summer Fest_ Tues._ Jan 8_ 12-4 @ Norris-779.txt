SummerFest
Tuesday, January 8th
12:00pm - 4:00pm
Norris University Center, 2nd Floor
Sponsored by The Office of the Provost and the Division of Student Affairs


Please plan to attend this expo type event that not only provides information tables on summer programs, summer classes, fellowships and research, but also helps to prepare Northwestern undergraduate students for application to competitive programs through internship search advice, resume reviews and services by Northwestern University Career Services and other career NU offices.


Various programs and departments within the Northwestern Community will also offer 20-minute how-to presentations to help you prepare for applications. And along with gaining great knowledge, having your questions answered… take a picture surfing with your friends on the “ultimate wave”, eat cotton candy and popcorn!
