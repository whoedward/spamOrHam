For this week IFN, we will be watching an Israeli comedy called "The Band's Visit" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYlLb0jm8U). It follows the Ceremonial Police Band of Alexandria, Egpyt that got lost during their visit to Israel for a cultural event. The film well-received among the critics, and it has also won various awards, including 7 Ophri Awards(the Israeli Oscars) in 2007. So come enjoy this great movie tomorrow at 8PM in the basement ! See you then !

Best,
Arkar
