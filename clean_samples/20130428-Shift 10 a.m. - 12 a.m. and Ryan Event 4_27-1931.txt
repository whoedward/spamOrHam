Hello Supers,

This email concerns this morning's shift and Ryan event. Ordinarily, I only work until ten o' clock; however, this morning there was a long set-up in McCormick, and I did not want to leave Brett alone before finishing. This was only a concern because Ahtif did not show up for his shift.
Please note that I personally am not remotely upset about this (hey, more hours). Mostly I am just concerned for Ahtif..

Additionally, however, we were also called up to Ryan auditorium because the client had no idea if anyone from NTS was present to help out. Jolo, who was scheduled for the event, contacted me afterwards, explaining that he was in Tech in one of the lecture rooms, but that the client could not find him. 
Just as before, I am not personally upset by this (I got in quite a bit of Techsercise), but the client did seem bothered by the absence of help.

Hopefully this does not seem like one big tattle. I was just hoping that you guys could help to clear up the ambiguity and gray areas.

Best,
Ethan Robison
