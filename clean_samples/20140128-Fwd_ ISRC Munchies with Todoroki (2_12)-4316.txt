Thanks Jonas!

Also, we're having an anniversary special coming up in the middle of February with BOGO free. Would you mind sending this out to your listserv? Thanks!
                                                                 

 
 
Todoroki Hibachi + Sushi Celebrating 2nd Anniversary Feb 18 with BOGO special
 

Evanston, Ill. â€“ Todoroki, a leading hibachi and sushi restaurant in the Evanston area, will be celebrating its 2nd anniversary (https://www.facebook.com/events/1502877686604576/) this coming winter by launching its boldest special on February 18-19!

As a show of appreciation to local diners and the Evanston/North Shore community for their support, Todoroki is expanding their annual buy-one-get-one free anniversary special to include all menu items, including all hibachi main courses and the popular all-you-can sushi menu.

The two-day celebration will be available to diners throughout the day with last call for seating at 6:30 pm. No other discounts will be honored in combination with the BOGO deal. Due to expected crowds, customers are advised to budget an additional 30 minute wait.

In addition, Todoroki will be hosting its annual sushi-eating contest in March involving both the Evanston and Northwestern communities. If you, your organization or company are interested in participating, please contact Angela Lee for more information. 

Public parking is available in the city garage, one block north with an entrance on Church Street, and also in the 500 Davis Center, one block east with an entrance on Hinman Avenue. The Metra Union Pacific North Line and the CTA Purple line both stop at Davis Street Stations.
