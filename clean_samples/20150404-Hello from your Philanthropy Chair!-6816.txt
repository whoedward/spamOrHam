Hello ISRC!


I am so thrilled to be your new Philanthropy Chair and working with you all this quarter!


First, I want to tell you all what I just did.


I just signed up for a really awesome event. I'm going to be walking around, enjoying music and games, hanging out with everyone on campus, all while making a difference and having tons of fun.

Doesn't that sound great?


I'm supporting the American Cancer Society and participating in Relay For Life® here at Northwestern! I would love for you guys to join Team Pineapple! Every Relay For Life event is a time for our school to honor cancer survivors, remember those lost to this disease, and raise funds and awareness to help end cancer forever.


Too many people will be touched by cancer this year. Our Relay For Life event is our opportunity to inspire hope by raising funds and awareness to help those facing the disease. I hope you guys join Team Pineapple! It will be a ton of fun. I can’t do this without you all.

There will be opportunities to fundraise and participate in events! More information to come. In the meantime, the event is Friday, May 15, at 6PM! Save the date!


See you all at Open Exec this Sunday!
