Hello Professor,

On Friday, there was an issue with the divide and conquer code, and you asked me to send you the .m file. However, after examining my code, I discovered the issue. To summarize, I used "ceil()" instead of "floor() +1," which does not work, of course. Thanks for you very much anyway. Take care.

Thank you,
Ethan Robison
