    I have nominated both of you to be members of the Technical Services Manager search committee. What that means is you will help read applications, decide who to interview over the phone, perform over the phone interviews and decide who to bring to campus for final rounds of interviews.  This is an amazing and paid opportunity to see the hiring process first hand.

     

    I will send more details as they come.

     

    Thanks,
