Hi ISRCers,


Hope you all had a lovely holiday break.  Now that the winter quarter has rolled around, here are some awesome Cross-ResCollege trips to look forward to!  I will be sending out e-mails on the following days with GoogleDoc forms for you all to be able to register, so look out for an e-mail from me during those times:

    Lookingglass Alice, Lookingglass Theater: Imagination soars and laughter and awe abound when this signature production returns with all its gravity-defying spectacle and breathtaking theatricality. Lookingglass Alice is a marvel for all ages, transporting audiences down the rabbit hole to a circus-infused playground for an exhilarating wonderland adventure inspired by Lewis Carroll’s beloved stories.  Adapted and directed by David Catlin from the works of Lewis Carroll; produced in association with The Actors Gymnasium. http://lookingglasstheatre.org/event_page/lookingglass-alice/

    White Guy on the Bus, Northlight Theater: Ray, a successful white business executive, rides the bus every Saturday. On his weekly ride he befriends Shatique, a young black woman putting herself through school and struggling to raise a son on her own. The threads that tie these disparate individuals together gradually unravel in a complex web of revenge, social mores and racial biases from a candid and unexpected perspective. http://www.northlight.org/
