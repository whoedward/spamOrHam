Hey everyone!
 
As usual, we will have our social/philanthropy committee meeting tonight at 8 PM!  And then, from right after the committee meeting until 11 PM, I will be in the the main lounge with supplies to make get-well cards for kids in the Evanston hospital.
 
Stop in for as much or as little time as you would like.  This will be one of our last philanthropy events of the quarter, and it will also be one of the easist ways all quarter to earn philanthropy points.  Whereas  most philanthropy events require you to go somewhere else on campus, or often even somewhere off-campus, for this, you don't even have to leave the dorm.  You can stop by the main lounge in slippers and pajamas if you want.
 
There will be stickers.  And glitter.
 
Come brighten a kid's day in the hospital.  Or come to play with the awesome Pokemon, Winnie-the-Pooh, Spongebob, Transformers, and Disney princess stickers I got. 
 
Whatever the reason, hope to see you there!
 
Best wishes,
 
Emily
