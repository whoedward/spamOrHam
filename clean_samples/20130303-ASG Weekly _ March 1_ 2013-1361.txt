> Unofficial Study Abroad Guide

>
> If you've studied abroad, we would greatly appreciate if you could take some time to complete the attached Word Doc forms regarding your own personal study abroad experiences and recommendations. We encourage candid and thorough answers, and guarantee complete anonymity.
>
> There are two separate questionnaire forms: one for where you studied abroad here and one for locations that you traveled to here. The priority should be to complete the form regarding your study abroad host city, but we would really appreciate you filling it out for cities you visited, too. 
>
> We ask that you answer the questions in a color rather than black, and once completed, please email the document, or any questions/concerns to asgstudyabroad@gmail.com.

> As you probably know Josie Nordman, a NU student, has cystic fibrosis and needs a lung transplant. People are trying to raise money so that her parents can afford the procedure when a lung becomes available. Josie's mom reached out to the NU community asking to arrange some sort of transportation system for Josie to and from class so that she doesn't have to brave the cold and schlep around her oxygen tank. So, students organized a google doc for people to sign up to drive her to class. If you are free at the times on the google doc and could help drive her, your help would truly be appreciated!  Please please please sign up for a slot on the google doc by filling out the Name and Phone Number Fields. The doc is organized by days and tells you at what time and where to pick her up and where to drop her off. In total, this is a TEN MINUTE commitment that could truly make a HUGE difference.
