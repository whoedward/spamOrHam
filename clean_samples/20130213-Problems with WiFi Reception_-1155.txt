> Hey everyone,
>
> As part of a greater push to improve WiFi signals across campus, ASG and your Hall Government encourages you to report any network issues, as they occur, to the NUIT Support Center at 847-491-4357 (HELP) for a prompt response. You can also report issues at https://itsm.northwestern.edu/SM7/ess.do. We also invite you to monitor the NUIT Service Status page at http://service-status.northwestern.edu/ for information related to IT service issues.

> If you have any other ideas on how we can improve Northwestern, don't hesitate to email your Senator or myself, or submit any other ideas to Campus Voice!
