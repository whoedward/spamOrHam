Hi guys,

I have a night class on Tuesdays and Thursdays this quarter so I can't teach on our usual Tuesday nights. For those who are still interested in learning judo, please email me back what times you are free so we can figure out a time that works for us all to meet. I'm free every weekday before 12am, Monday nights, Wednesday nights, Friday between 1pm-5pm (besides this coming Friday), and before 3pm on Sundays.
