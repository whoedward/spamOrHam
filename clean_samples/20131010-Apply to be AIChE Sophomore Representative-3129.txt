Hey 210ers!

I stopped by your class this week to announce that American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is opening up elections for sophomore representatives. Responsibilities for this role would include:

- Attending weekly AIChE Executive Board meetings
- Helping to organize AIChE events
- Passing along information to sophomores and relaying information back from your classmates to the executive board

Sophomore representative is a great position to get exposure to AIChE and build up leadership experience. It's also FUN and a pretty low time commitment.  If you are interested, please fill out this form by next Wednesday (10/16).

More information will come out about voting once we get all the applications.

If you have any questions please feel free to email me,
