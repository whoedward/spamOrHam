Hey everyone!
 
The hot chocolate sale to support our DM team will be next Tuesday, the 22nd, at the Rock.  Sign up for shifts to run the table at the Doodle below!

Ideally, we'd like at least two people running each shift. 
 
You will earn philanthropy points for participating!  (And you will be helping ISRC's DM team.)
 
Sign up!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
 
P.S.  If you can't help run the table, you can earn a philanthropy point by baking something for us to sell.  E-mail me if you'd like to bake something!
