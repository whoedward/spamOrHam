Hi! I have a another meeting (unity) scheduled at the same time:( Our show is scheduled in four weeks so these couple of meetings are really important for me to attend! I was wondering if it’ll be ok for me not attend meetings for the first couple of weeks? After the show is over I’ll make sure to come! If there are shifts that need to be covered please let me know and I’ll try to help out as much as I can.

Best,

Angela
