Hey, guys,

We thought it would be a good idea to take some pictures after instruction tomorrow so that we can use them for club sign-up purposes and updating our website. We want to get some cool action shots as well as a group photo, if possible. I have a couple of my friends who are willing to come after instruction tomorrow to take the pictures for us. With that being said, I would very much appreciate your guys' cooperation, so please do come out and help. Hope to see you all at practice :)
