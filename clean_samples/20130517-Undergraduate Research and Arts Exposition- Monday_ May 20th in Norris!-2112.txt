Subject: Undergraduate Research and Arts Exposition- Monday, May 20th in Norris!

Our Expo event is ready for prime time!  I hope that you can help us spread the word about the Expo on Monday.  We have poster sessions from 10-11:30 and 2:30-4:00.  We have eight oral presentation panels (two sets of four panels from 11-12:30 and 1-2:30).  We have a new library session, helping to teach students how to get started on a project from 3:30-5:00.  We also have our Creative Arts Festival from 6:30-8:30 with a professional jury including a filmmaker from New York and the heads of a major local casting agency.  All of it takes place in Norris with a home base at our registration table on the second floor (except for the Creative Arts Festival which is in McCormick Auditorium).  Please help me in spreading the word about this one-of-a-kind celebration of undergraduate student work.  More info can be found here:  http://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/expo Thanks.
