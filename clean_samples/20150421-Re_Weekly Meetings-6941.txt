Hey Daniel,

Our meeting slot is from 7-8PM.  Though we usually end earlier, we can't guarantee it.  Is there any way you can come at 7 or a bit beforehand?  That way we can get your availability and maybe give shifts right at the beginning of the meeting.  If you have academic commitments before that, though, we completely understand.

Best,
Christina

        Daniel,

        Thanks for submitting your paperwork! Please come to our weekly meetings, which are Wednesdays at 7PM. The location is TBA, but we usually email the information out beforehand.

        At the meeting, we'll get you introduced to the rest of the staff, and we will also give you on some shifts. Please come prepared with your availability!

        From,
        Michael Wang
