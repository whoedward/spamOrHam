    Norris Student Staff:
    We are looking for students to help us distribute Commencement tickets and provide information to graduates and families during Senior Week.  Are you on campus that week and looking for a way to make some money?

    Here are the details:
    Monday, June 17, 4:00pm-7:00pm
    Tuesday, June 18, 9:30am-8pm
    Wednesday, June 19, 9:30am-7pm
    Thursday, June 20, 8:30am-4pm 

    Pay is $10 per hour.  These are regular wages—work study not required. Please note that if you're working for Norris (or any other campus job) your total hours cannot surpass 40 for the week. 

    Please email me with your interest, and specific dates and times you are available to work. If you've worked this job in the past, we're doing it a little differently this year—we'll stuff tickets into the regalia bags on Monday, then have a small staff available for questions/assistance for graduates and their families throughout the rest of the week.

    Let me know if you're interested or have any questions.

    Thanks so much, 
    Amy
