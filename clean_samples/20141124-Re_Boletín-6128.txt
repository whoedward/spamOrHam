Just to let you know - I made the changes to the individual copies of each, not the ones in the big file

        Hey, turns out I changed all I needed to. On Google Drive there were three documents that didn't have the same name format as the others - my description, and your argument/narrative. I changed these on the drive

        Thanks a lot for putting it all together!
