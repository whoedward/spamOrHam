Hey ISRC-ers!

So since it's been getting warmer outside (theoretically) more outside activities are occurring in the Chicago area. This is a great opportunity for you to take advantage of these events with friends! Because of this, I have searched the interwebs for fun, engaging activity we can do together that require no past skill or knowledge. This lead me to....

THE GLO RUN

The Glo Run is a 5k run/walk in Chicago. Basically it's a route covered in blacklights where you can paint up and take amazing pictures under. There's a dj and after-party at Bar Louie's where you can eat to your hearts' desire. Here's the link to this amazing event.
