Hi EA1 Students,
Midterm 2 is coming up next week on Thursday, Nov. 15, at 7:00pm. Here are the rooms you will go to:

Section 20,21: LR2
Section 22,23: Tech Auditorium

The midterm will cover everything from the start of linear algebra lectures (Wed. of week 5) up to (and including) matrix inverses (Thurs. of week 7). This includes the network flows case study. Please refer to the course schedule posted on Blackboard to verify what material you should know, as each professor may have gone at his own pace.

There will not be a practice midterm posted. The best way to study is to go over your homework assignments, all of which are posted on Blackboard under Documents.

Best of luck preparing!

-Ilya Mikhelson
