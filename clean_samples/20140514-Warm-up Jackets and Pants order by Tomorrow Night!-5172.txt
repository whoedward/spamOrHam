Hey guys, 

Remember to order the warm-up jackets and pants by tomorrow before you regret it!! :)

Also, come out to KASA Show this Friday at 8:00pm in Ryan Auditorium (Tech) to support our club members! We will probably be going first, so if you are coming, don't be late!

Hope ya'll are surviving school.
