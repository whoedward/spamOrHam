Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I hope you guys are having a great weekend so far! In case any of you didn't know, which is unlikely since I've introduced myself about a thousand times (but I forgive you if you didn't meet me/don't remember), I'm Ayla and I'm Philanthropy Chair of ISRC! I love my job, but I'd love it even more if some of you wanted to help me plan philanthropy events and join the PHILANTHROPY COMMITTEE! Basically, the philanthropy committee would be an informal group of a small number of ISRCers (no limit, really) who meet one night each week in the main lounge to discuss philanthropy stuff for 10-20 minutes. It's a great way to get a little more involved without committing too much of your time. And you could probably get 1/2 a philanthropy point for each phil committee meeting you attend, but I can't guarantee that. Probably, though. :) The thing I would need the most help with is organizing/fundraising for the ISRC Dance Marathon team, so if you want to do DM this year, this is a great way to REALLY be a part of it. :) But you can also be on phil committee without doing DM. There are no elections for this - you just volunteer and agree to going to as many phil committee and open exec meetings as possible. That means ideally attending every meeting and missing only for emergencies. But I'm understanding. :) EMAIL ME SOON IF YOU WANT TO BE ON PHILANTHROPY COMMITTEE, AND COME TO OPEN EXEC SUNDAY AT 8:30 IN THE MAIN LOUNGE AND TALK TO ME IN PERSON!!!!! Thank you guys so much!

ISRClove,
Ayla
