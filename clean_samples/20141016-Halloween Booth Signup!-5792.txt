Hello my fellow supervisors,

SAM is getting all set up for Halloween next week in the Nor, and one of the activities we will be up to is setting up a photo booth station on the ground floor to take some Halloween snaps of people during lunch time 10/21-23 and hand out caramel apple suckers (!)

We need a couple people to help us work the booth taking pics and handing out the suckers, so if you're working during this time please sign up for a shift! Thanks!
