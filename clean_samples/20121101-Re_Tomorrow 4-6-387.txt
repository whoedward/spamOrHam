    Hi NTS!

    I know this is last minute, but it's not a big deal if no one can cover this. Would anyone be able to cover my 4-6 shift tomorrow? A local family that I know just asked me today if I could babysit for them in that time. If no one can cover my shift I will just tell them no, but I'd like to help them out. If you can, thanks a bunch and I am willing to cover one of your shifts in return.
