Provisionally at least

Right now I need to contact the other teams to ask them if that would be OK, but since I don't have any of their e-mails, I have to wait for Profs. Holtgrieve or Herrick to let me verify with them that Thrusday 2-3

For now consider it good and if it isn't it'll get pushed back to Friday or Saturday
