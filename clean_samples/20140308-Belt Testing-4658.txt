Hey, guys,

I just wanted to let you know that this upcoming week will be our last week of official practices for the quarter. Monday will just be a regular practice, and Wednesday we will have our belt testing. The belt testing forms are attached below, one for color belts and the other for the pretest black belts. If you are planning on testing, please fill out these forms and bring them on Wednesday. Master Baek and Master Kallo, I believe, should arrive at 8:30 P.M. on Wednesday for the testing, so come a little beforehand to stretch and warm up.

We will still have a Saturday session this week.

Enjoy your reading week (if you have one).
