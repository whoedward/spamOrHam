Greetings,

I received more requests for Sunday morning practices (and I also would't be able to make a Saturday practice this weekend anyway) so we will be having BJJ practice Sunday 11am-1pm at Blomquist. If you said Sunday works for you then show up!

Depending on how many people show up, we may continue this way in the future, or we might go back to Saturday. To all of you who can't do Sunday morning, I apologize.  It is impossible to accomodate everyone. Let me know if you can't make Sunday mornings and maybe we can organize some midweek practices throughout the quarter for you all (assuming we continue on Sundays).

-Jacob
