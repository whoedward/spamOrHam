And according to one of the comments, Pacman is actually on a cylinder segment, since he can't pass through the top or bottom boundaries. I may have lost some street cred for getting that wrong, but you all (particularly Ryan) lost some too for not correcting me.

Another comment has someone's version of Snake visualized on a torus. There is a Youtube video that illustrates what I was talking about.
