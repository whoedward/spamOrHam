Hi NTS, here are the meeting notes from tonight

Announcements:

There have been a few instances of things being left out overnight or over long periods of time during the day. Please make sure you are checking the sheets and breaking down sets in a timely manner. If you are on a closing shift, make sure you do a full sweep of the building, and check all the rooms that had events during the day to make sure there is nothing left over from a set.

If you don't know how to set up certain equipment, don't hesitate to ask the other person on shift, the supervisors or Michael. We would much rather have to explain something to you than have to scramble to fix equipment that was set up improperly.

There are a large amount of events that need to be set early tomorrow morning (1/17) , so if you are on the open, please get to Norris by 7:45.

Otherwise, good job so far this quarter!

Alex
