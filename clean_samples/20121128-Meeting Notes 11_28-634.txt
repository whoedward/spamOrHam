Hi NTS,

Here are the notes from this weeks meeting.

Announcements

Please make sure you are sweeping the building during your shifts and putting away equipment/turning off projectors. We don't want to start emailing people about this, but if we have to, we will.

We are going to start scheduling for next quarter soon. Please fill out the Google Doc with your schedule for Winter Quarter. I know that it may not be finalized at this point, but we need to get a schedule out since we are going to be working as soon as we get back from Winter break. Its the same thing as last quarter; if you have any scheduling notes/preferences, just put them at the bottom of the sheet. Also, indicate how many hours you want to work during winter quarter.

Try to fill out the Google Doc by the time you leave for Winter Break, the faster we get this filled, the faster we can get a schedule out for next quarter.

The Time Clock(where you swipe in) is going to be down this Sunday. If you cannot swipe in, just email your hours to Michael.

Finals Week information

Since Norris is still open all finals week, we need people in the building at all times. There are pretty much no events going on during the week, so your shifts should be light and you should be able to study most of the time. If you have any conflicts, such as a final, or even something like needing more time to finish a paper, send out an email over the listserv so people can get your shift covered ASAP. We covered a lot of the shifts during the meeting, so I'm sending out a schedule that's only for finals week.

If you are interested in working over Winter Break, please email Michael. The pay does not come out of your work-study allotment and the events are generally pretty easy.

There is an early open tomorrow, at 7:30am.
