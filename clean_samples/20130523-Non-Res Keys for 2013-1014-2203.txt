Hi ISRC!

For those of you who are not living in ISRC next year, but still want to maintain contact with the dorm, there is the option to non-res. As a non-res, you get a key which gives you access to the dorm. You also get to stay on the ISRC listserv, so you can find out about upcoming events. This gives you the ability to attend cross-RC trips, dorm socials, and the RCB formal. (You can still attend the all-you-can-eat sushi social even though you no longer live in ISRC!!) The Residential College office will have a non-resident form in the new school year, which you just have to fill out and pay social dues for the key.

If you're interested being a non-res for next year, email me. In the fall, you will be able to fill out the form and pay your social dues. The more people we have sign up to non-res, the cheaper the social dues will be. Hopefully, they will be around $20.00 for the year.

Let me know if you're interested!

ISRCLove,

Nathan
