Hello Michael,

First, I would like to thank you for your consideration. Second, I would like to apologize for my delayed response-somehow I overlooked the one email that I was actually searching for.

I am available on Monday the 22nd and Wednesday the 24th at any time except for the hours from 11 a.m. to noon. Optimal times are those from 1 to 5 p.m.
Hopefully this is helpful.

Thanks,
Ethan

    Congratulations,

     

    You have been selected to interview for the position of Norris Technical Supervisor.  Please let me know your availability on the week of April 22nd-24th.  Please give multiple dates and times that would work for you as I have quite a few interviews to perform. I am going to make my final hiring decisions on April 26th.  Please be prepared for an hour long interview.  Come with plenty of questions and answers.

    Between now and your interview I would like you to answer a question.  Take your time, think about it and email me your best answer.  Here is the question: “If you could be any Superhero, existing or self-created what would your name be and what powers would you have?”  - email your answer to Michael.mckean@northwestern.edu

     

    Once again congratulations and good luck!
