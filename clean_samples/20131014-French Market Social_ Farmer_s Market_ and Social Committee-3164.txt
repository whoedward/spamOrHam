Hey ISRC,

I'm letting you know about our first social of the quarter. We'll be taking the Metra downtown to the French Market on Saturday October 26. We'll leave at around 11:00 and return around 1:30. Here is a link to the French Market's webpage for those of you who haven't heard of it. We'll pay for your ticket and about $13 at the market. Let me know if this interests you. We have room for 10 people. If I get more than that many responses in the next couple hours, I'll do a new email, to make it fair.

Also, this Saturday morning, we'll be going to Evanston Farmer's Market. We won't be paying for it, but it'll be fun to go in a group. This also gets us points for Green Cup. We'll probably head out around 10:30 or so. You can bring your parents too, since it's Family Weekend and you can show them all the good, wholesome fun Evanston provides. Tell me if you are planning on coming.

Finally, I need to form a Social Committee. If having a say in how the dorm spends your money to have fun is something that interests you, then you belong on the committee. Meetings won't be long, but we'll try to get stuff done. Tell me if you want to be a part of it.

Can't wait to hear back,
Jonas
