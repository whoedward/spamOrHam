    Hey Everyone, 

    Just a reminder that TOMORROW is RCB Field Day from 1pm to 5pm at the Lakefill. 

    If you are participating in one of the competitive events (i.e. you signed up for like tug of war, or capture the flag, etc.), meet in the Main Lounge at 12:15pm tomorrow so I can go over some details for those specific events. 

    For EVERYONE, we will be leaving as a group to go to Field Day at 12:40pm.This way we can get our free food before the events start.

    If you can't come for the full time please come for as much as you can! I have attached the schedule of events so you all can see what is happening when. 

    Get excited everyone! There's going to be food, music, RCB gear, a bounce house, an obstacle course, and a chance to throw water balloons at me. 

    This is a great time to build ISRC Spirit, and win some trophies!!!!!

    See you all tomorrow!
