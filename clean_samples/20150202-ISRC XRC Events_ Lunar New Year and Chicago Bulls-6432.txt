Hi all,

Below are the links for the Cross Res-College trip for Lunar New Year dining out at The Phoenix Restaurant and the Chicago Bulls Game.  We have only a few spots open, so it's first come first serve (wait list will be available for those who are not the first few to sign up). If you have any questions or concerns regarding payment for Cross RC trips, please feel free to e-mail me (jen.guo@u.northwestern.edu) or the ISRC Master, Alec (alec-klein@northwestern.edu), as we want all students to be able to attend!
