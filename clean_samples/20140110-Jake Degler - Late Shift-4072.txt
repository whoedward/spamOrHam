Michael and Supes,

Jake showed up late for work today. His excuse was that he overslept. Since it's a new quarter, Ethan and I had a sit down with him and made it clear that we've been excessively lenient before (a mistake we won't make again) and that this warning is his last one.

I know firing people sucks, but I would like to have everyone's agreement on this: If he makes another error like this, we ought to let him go.

From,
Michael
