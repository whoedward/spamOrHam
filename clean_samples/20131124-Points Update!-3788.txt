Hey ISRCers!

This quarter is almost over, and chances to earn points and getting on lists are dwindling down! I see several of you are very close to 3rd list, so if you'd like to receive a personalized e-mail from me with advice on how to get those last few points, let me know via e-mail.

Also, I will be holding points review sessions in the main lounge during reading week. Schedule an appointment with me and I will take time to talk about your points face-to-face.

Thanks y'all!
Thomas
