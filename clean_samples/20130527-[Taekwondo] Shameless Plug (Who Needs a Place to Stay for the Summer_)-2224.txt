Hey everyone,

So the pizza party social and movie thing was a lot of fun, and looking back on it, I recall many compliments about the many nice luxuries of my apartment. I also recall that my lease extends through the summer, but my room will be void of people during that time.

What this means is that there's a great opportunity for you if you need a place to stay over the summer. If you're interested, let me know!
