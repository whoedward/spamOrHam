GUESS WHO MADE THE PLAYOFFS FOR BOTH BASKETBALL AND HOCKEY

THAT'S RIGHT
BEST DORM EVER
ISRC

Congrats to everyone, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KILLING IT THIS QUARTER
ALL OF YOU ARE AWESOME

That being said, playoffs for basketball start tomorrow. I know, I'm sorry - if you can't make it I completely understand.
But if you CAN, then please meet at the lobby at 6:40 PM tomorrow night in the lobby so we can head over to Blom together (if you can't make it at 6:40 then just meet us at Blom). Our game is at 7PM, tomorrow, Monday February 24, vs Team 413 (yeah, I dunno what that means either)

Hockey playoffs start next Monday, March 3, at 8PM.

Peace and love. Hope yall enjoyed ID.
