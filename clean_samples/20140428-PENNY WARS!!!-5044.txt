Attention ISRC!

Penny wars begins today! It is a competition between the floors with the winners receiving FREE PIZZA!!
In the evenings this week, I'll be in the main hall with bowls for each floor. Change will count positively toward the floor and cash will count negatively. 
All proceeds will help ISRC beat the other RCs in RCB penny wars and that money will go to our Relay for Life team. Come donate and support your floor!
