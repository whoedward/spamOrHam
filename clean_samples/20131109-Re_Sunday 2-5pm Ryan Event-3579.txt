Awesome - thanks very much.  I'll give my number to Pete's person too, just in case there's a problem.

Thanks again,
Ryan

    Hey Ryan

    The other supers and I discused it and it's totally fine if you just give the client your number and run up to your review session. Make sure to tell the client and Pete's person where you'll be and all is good.

    Best,
    Ethan
