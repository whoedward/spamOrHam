Hi NTS,

Sorry for the late notice, but we are still having a meeting today, from 7-8pm in the Rock Room. If you can't make the meeting, please email  ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason, and make sure you include any shifts you would need to get covered through the rest of the quarter.

Thanks,

Alex
