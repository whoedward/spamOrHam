Hi Angela,

I am emailing you concerning meetings this quarter. As far as I understand, you have another meeting scheduled at the same time. We'd like you to split your attendance between the two, if you would kindly. Because meetings are when most of the scheduling gets done, this will make it easier for you and for us to make sure that things are taken care of.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me or NTSsupervisors@gmail.com.

Best,
