Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a good review day! We were able to go through the fights we had already choreographed for the first time since before break, which was definitely helpful. Our work is cut out for us!
    We also have now finished blocking the entire show! We’re going to take the next two days to review and work anything that needs polishing and/or reworking in both Acts, but we hope not to change any blocking. Once those two days of review are done, we’ll have our first full run-through on Saturday!

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    When will we be getting rehearsal knives (not the retractable ones) and/or guns?

Costume Notes:

    Alex needs to have a costume for a soldier (not Octavius or Antony’s servant)
    Soldiers have to switch sides (in Act V, just to signify that they are now Antony’s and Octavius’ soldiers) and that needs to be clear.
    Definitely need knee pads and places to put knives for all soldiers.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    We will be having an initial run-through of the entire show this Saturday from 2-6! Let me know if you’re interested in attending.
