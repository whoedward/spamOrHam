Hey everyone,

Here is the ballot for the ISRC Election! This form contains candidates and ISRC constitutional amendments, so please read carefully! We have 1 contested position, President, so pay special attention to the candidates for that.

I will attach the proposed ISRC Constitution with its new amendments. Look over the highlighted points since I only list the number of the clause in the actual form.

You have until 9:30pm Monday February 17th to vote! Pay attention to a possible follow-up vote in the next few days.

Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/forms/d/1PSqhrxCgLCHigfpkc4FgkEceuzW_-ysbwzR5GipAaAw/viewform

And remember:


OBEY THE HAMSTER!

Ciao,
Thomas
