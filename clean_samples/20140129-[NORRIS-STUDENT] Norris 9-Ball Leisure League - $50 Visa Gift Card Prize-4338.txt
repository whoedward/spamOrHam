Fellow Employees of Norris,

The Norris Game Room will be hosting the 9-Ball Leisure League Tournament once again for all Norris employees! Any and all employees interested in pool, 9-ball, hanging out, meeting people, or even just winning money, regardless of skill level, is encouraged to enter!

There is no entry fee, but you do get the chance to win a $50 Visa Gift Card!

Think you don't have time? No worries. You will be able to schedule when to play your own match with your opponent throughout the week. Matches shouldn't take long and can be completed during a shift break, in-between classes, or anytime the Game Room is open!

If you're interested, please email your name, contact info, and Norris department to me at KevinGuo2014@u.northwestern.edu before the registration deadline of Friday, February 7th.

Attached is a flyer (so you can put it up in your department :) as well as the rules and regulations of the tournament. Take a look at it to learn how to play 9-ball and for more information on the league!

More exclamation points!!!!

Thanks and Good Luck,

Kevin Guo
