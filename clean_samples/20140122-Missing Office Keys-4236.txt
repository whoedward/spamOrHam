Hey all,

We are currently missing 2 of our 3 office keys. If anyone has any idea of where the keys may be we ask that you return them to the info desk as soon as possible. 

We realize that it is fairly easy to accidentally leave them either lying around or in your pocket and would like you all to know that absolutely no punishment or disciplinary action will be taken if that is the case. You can return the key to the info desk with no questions asked. 

Thanks for everyone's help on this,
Bobby Ramirez
