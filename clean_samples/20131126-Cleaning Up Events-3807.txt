Hey All,

This morning I found an HDMI cable, the HDMI/VGA converter kit, and a presentation remote dongle left out in Wildcat. This is just a reminder about making sure that things are put away.
On your shift, be sure to peek around the building once or twice to check on empty rooms, and on the close, be sure to thoroughly sweep the entire building.

If anyone has any questions, email me or any of the other supers and we will do our best to help.

Regards,
Ethan
