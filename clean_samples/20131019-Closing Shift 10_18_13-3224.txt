Hey Will,

I'm emailing you regarding your closing shift last night (10/18/13). In particular, the LEDs (spots) in McCormick were left on, an A/V bag was left in the Hollow, and one of the walkies was not seated in its cradle properly.
This email serves to remind you of the importance of general upkeep as a part of your job in Tech Services. If you ever need any help doing anything, don't hesitate to contact any of the Supers or returning techs, all of whom are glad to help wherever they can.

If this information is inaccurate, or if you have any questions, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com right away.

Regards,
Ethan Robison
