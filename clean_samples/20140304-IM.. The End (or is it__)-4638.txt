HEy all,

So.. yeah. With two rather drastic endings, our good times with IM this quarter, like all times, has come to an end.

A sincere thank you to all who have participated- thank you, thank you, thank you so much! You guys are the best, and I have some really great memories from this quarter playing with you guys and getting closer to a lot of you. 

In all I'd say IM was pretty successful - I think I could have done better explaining some sports (read: basketball) but I feel like we all got to meet/get to know new people (read: hey men of third floor!! you guys held down the fort, much thanks. also to the nice chapin people we met as well) and get to know better people we already knew which is honestly one of the main goals of IM for the dorm at least in my opinion so
thanks so much for a great season
early playoff exits are still playoff appearances
you guys are the best
go isrc
see you next quarter
good luck with midterms etc
