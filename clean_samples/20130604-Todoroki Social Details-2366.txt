Hey everyone, we've recently come into some more money for the sushi social, so we're able to take more people! To allow more people to come, it's still $5.00 per person ($17 normally).

Jonas doesn't like sushi so I will be leading the social.

Let's meet on Thursday in the 1st floor hallway at 11:15 so we can walk over together.

Here is list of people who are set to go:
1. Matthew Zhou
2. Danny Callison
3. Nathan Richards
4. Leena Vilonen
5. Emily Kaht
6. Monika Hur
7. Hannah Martenson
8. Eric Niemeyer 
9. Hyo Lee
10. Derek Oung
11. Michael McCauley

IF YOU WOULD STILL LIKE TO GO ON THE SOCIAL, REPLY TO THIS EMAIL AND WE'LL ENTER YOU INTO THE LOTTERY FOR 10 MORE SPOTS. 

Thanks,
Kyle
