Hello Dr. You,

I am emailing in regards to my eligibility for Spanish 201. Regretably, there is no way for me to determine whether or not I am capable of taking the class in time for tomorrow's registration. For that reason, I would like to know if you have any suggestions as to classes that I should take instead. I will be contacting the professors in Weinberg regarding enrollment as soon as possible, but in the meantime would like to have another class to replace Spanish if necessary.

If you have any recommendations, I would very gladly hear them.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
