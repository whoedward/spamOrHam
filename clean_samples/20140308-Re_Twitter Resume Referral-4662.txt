Hi Mark,

I'd love to look into it. Please tell me what I can do to get in touch with the individual in question.
If there is anything else that I can provide for you, please let me know.

Regards,

    Yesterday, I received a call from an alumni at Twitter interested in resumes of graduating seniors for full time opportunities as well as juniors and sophomores (as well as non-graduating master's students) for summer internships.

    Your resume was sent along.  If you are interested in the opportunity, can you let me know ASAP?  Additionally, if you have already accepted a job or internship, or are not interested in Twitter, can you also let me know?

    Thanks,


    Mark Presnell
