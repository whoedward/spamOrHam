Hello Cornelius,

I am emailing you in regards to the proper layout/template for a lab report. I am not sure if I missed an email or was simply not paying attention, but I am not entirely sure as to how I should format my report. I have something written up (which I will send you shortly), but I would prefer to be on the right track when I do.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison
