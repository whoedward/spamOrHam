Dear Justin Notestein,

I know the end of the semester is a busy time for you and your students. I wouldn't write if I didn't think it was important to reach you before the winter break.

As you know, undergraduate students are eligible for membership in AIChE at no cost. I'm concerned that we haven't heard from some of the students in your Chapter about renewing their memberships. If they don't renew soon they'll miss out on valuable benefits.

As a Student Chapter Advisor, you know the benefit of AIChE membershipâ€¦please remind your students to renew today so they can benefit, too.

Please forward this email to all your students so those that haven't renewed can do so with just one click:

Renew AIChE Student Membership for 2012-2013

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Bette Lawer
