Hey guys,
 
So far, it’s looking like the best date is Friday the 6th (Sorry Alex and Helix ☹, is there no way you guys can make that date?)  On the other hand, I personally have no qualms about having a social both Friday and Saturday...  so that’s an option too if people feel up for it.
 
For those who haven’t filled out the doodle poll and are interested, there’s still time, go quickly!  I’ll probably send out another doodle for times tomorrow.
