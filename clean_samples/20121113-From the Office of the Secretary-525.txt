> The tenth annual Northwestern University Conference on Human Rights (NUCHR) will take place on Northwestern's Evanston campus from January 17th-20th, 2013. Throughout the three day conference, delegates will explore the complexities behind international and local Peacekeeping. The conference will open with a discussion of the definitions and justifications of Peacekeeping as a form of dealing with international conflicts. Participants of the first panel will present and justify different approaches to international peacekeeping, weighing the pros and cons of each method of Peacekeeping. In the two following panels, experts in the field will discuss issues of immunity and impunity, bureaucratic barriers, political implications, and the creation of conditions for sustaining peace. Additionally, delegates will explore the pros and cons of local Peacekeeping efforts by participating in an experiential learning trip to several Chicago neighborhoods. Finally, delegates will break up into small groups throughout the three days for further discussion on the topics presented.
