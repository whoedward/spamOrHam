    Ethan,
    I've just received word the library plotter is back up and running, looks like it'll stay that way. So you should be able to print from a main library computer, just follow the instructions here:

    Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

            Hello all,
            Firstly, I'm sorry for all of the confusion regarding printing: the library plotter breaking down is out of our hands. That said, if you have not printed your poster yet, please respond to this email with your section and team number.

            Even if you have already contacted your professor, myself, or another TA: if at this moment you have not yet printed--please respond to this email with your information. We're making alternate printing arrangements.

            Another reminder: please email your poster file to me! It is not optional, professors are looking for them.

            Thank you for your patience, we'll get it all sorted out before tomorrow.
            -Sam
