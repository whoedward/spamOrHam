Student-Faculty Interaction Grants

Beginning this academic year, students and faculty members can apply for Student-Faculty Interaction Grants.  These grants provide funds that enable you to build meaningful experiences for your students. Grants will be available for undergraduates in a number of settings: your classes, seminars, advising groups, residences, and other places.

Read more about the Student-Faculty Interaction Grants here. 

Title IX Petition

Faculty members have created a petition urging Northwestern's Board of Trustees to review Title IX policies. Petition available here.

ASG Presents: Administrator Round Tables

Wish you had more face time with Northwestern administrators? Have an idea you want to propose, a question about a policy, or a criticism about a program?

Every Thursday evening from 7-8 PM, ASG will be hosting a different Northwestern Administrator. Each Round Table will be capped at 25 students to facilitate discussion.

RSVP for our Winter Series here.
Attend the Facebook Event here. 

Want to make your student group more sustainable?

Members of the ASG Sustainability Committee would like to provide advice and resources to reduce your group's environmental impact. Through our contacts and experience in sustainability, we have many avenues to reduce waste in easy ways. Sustainable practices do not have to be a burden, and we at the GEC group want to help you save resources (and potentially money!) while helping to save the planet.

If you are interested in making your group more green, please fill out this initial survey form so that our team can develop an idea of your sustainability needs.  We will then have a meeting, set up a timeline for your event, and provide all the help we can to reduce the environmental impact of your group.

Submit Feedback to Campus Voice

Campus Voice is ASG's campus-wide feedback platform that lets students submit ideas, report problems, and ask questions.

Want to give ASG your feedback? Submit to Campus Voice here.
