Hi Dr. Riesbeck,

I mistakenly thought that my registration was a day later than it actually was, and as a result some of the classes that I wanted to take are full. I was unsure as to in which class I should enroll. I was considering either algorithms (EECS 336) or a theme course. Please let me know what you think.

Best,
