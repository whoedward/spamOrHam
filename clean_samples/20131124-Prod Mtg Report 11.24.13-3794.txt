General Notes:

·      Melanie gave us a comprehensive presentation about receipts/how to get reimbursed for expenditures—if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask Matt!

·      This week, Matt will be connecting with lead designers about budget; will be asking for high and low end of spectrum for desired budget

Set Notes:

    Nothing new—Maia and Nikolaj talked briefly about platforms, will be changing a little bit
    Would like to be mostly finalized going into winter break, but Maia can still get in contact with Nikolaj before/during break if there are any revelations

Prop Notes:

    Props list is on the Drop Box!
    Mostly questions about set dressing that need to be discussed with set
    Other than that, not much

Costume Notes:

    We had an awesome presentation for ideas with almost all of the characters—thanks!
    Maia will be sending a reminder email to those conspirators who haven’t sent Jessica any information about their characters

    Ghost of Caesar—may just be bloody Caesar, will be playing more with mask ideas
    General look for soldiers and commoners should be developed a little bit more
    Will be getting in contact with you for measurements info soon.

Light Notes:

    Gus and Justin have been talking about hand-held flashlights, may need to be updated more on this because lights will be different
    Perhaps super-powerful single LED lights?

Sound Notes:

    Nothing new—will be working on cues

Publicity Notes:

    Nothing much new—publicity push in about a week for the roast
