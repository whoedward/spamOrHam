Hey ISRC,

Kyle and I are leading a social to the Art Institute this Saturday. We will leave ISRC at 1:00 pm and return sometime between 6 and 7. For simplicity's sake you guys can cover the 'L' fare, and as NU students, we'll get into the museum for free. So, ISRC will cover dinner for you. So, we will be eating at the Oasis Cafe, and possibly get dessert after wards. 10 spots will go out at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. Be ready!

Hope to hear from you soon,
Jonas
