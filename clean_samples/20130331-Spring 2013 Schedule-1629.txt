Hi NTS,

Here's a rough schedule for spring quarter. If you don't have any shifts, that means you haven't given us your schedule. If you still wish to work regular shifts during spring quarter, you need to send your schedule in ASAP.

I tried to give everyone at least one of their preferred shifts, as well as give them around the amount of hours they requested.

Send any conflicts/complaints you have to me, I'll get a revised schedule out by tomorrow night.

Thanks,

Alex
