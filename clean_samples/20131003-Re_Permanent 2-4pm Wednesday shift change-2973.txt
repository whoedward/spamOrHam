    Hey everyone,

    So I just found out one of the groups I'm involved in has changed their meeting time to 3:30-5pm on Wednesdays.  I'm scheduled for the 2-4pm shift currently; I was wondering if anybody would be willing to take it permanently.  It's not a bad shift, and you'd really be helping me out.

    Thanks,
    Ryan
