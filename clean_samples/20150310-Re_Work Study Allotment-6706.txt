Well she could ask Chris to put her on regular pay, but I think he's running out of money to pay people out of NTS's pocket.

    Hey Christine,

    So I was just informed today that I am approaching my Work Study Allotment, and cannot ask for an increase. Is there any way Norris can help with this issue? If not, I will have to reduce my hours at Norris to two hours a week most likely, in order to spread my allotment over the whole quarter. If there is anything else I can do, please let me know.

    All the best,
