Dear Jillian and Brian,

We apologize for the inconvenience, but due to an exam conflict there was a last minute change as to the time of the design presentation. The presentation has been moved from next Wednesday the  12th to Tuesday the 11th, from 7-9 PM. Please let us know if you can still make the presentation.

Thanks,
Team 3
