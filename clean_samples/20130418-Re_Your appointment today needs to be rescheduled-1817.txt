    Hi Ethan,

     

    My sincerest apologies, but due to a medical issue I have to cancel all of my appointments today.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you; please feel free to reschedule for another time slot next week.  Let me know if there are no available slots that fit your schedule; I will try to accommodate you as best as possible.
