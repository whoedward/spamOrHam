Hi everyone,

It's Paul again. Now, I know what you're thinking, but no, IM is not over yet, and yes, that does mean you will keep receiving these e-mails (sorry, or you're welcome, whichever applies)

Time for some news

We are playing 'Barely Legal' (yeah, I dunno) Monday, March 3rd, at Patten Gym at 8 PM for our first playoff match. Wear black and bring your WILDCards. Meet at the lobby around 7:35. If you cannot make it I totally understand- in fact I have a midterm examination at 7 so I will be late. Will I'm counting on you to hold down the fort- please take everybody to Patten.
If you want to play tomorrow, please please come! Roster freeze has begun, so you can only come if you are on the roster, which is a list of people I heard were interested/people that have come previously. http://nuim.northwestern.edu/team.php?team=4682 is the roster hyperlink, you may be on there. If not, I apologize, but we cannot modify the roster as of February 27th.

Alright. Go team. Who still loves IM? (Answer: you, dear readers, probably, and me too)

-Paul

P.s. ISRC ON THREE ONE TWO THREE
(This is your cue to respond to this e-mail with 'ISRC'. hashtag carpe diem)
