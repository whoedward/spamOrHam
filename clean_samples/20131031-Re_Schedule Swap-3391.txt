Hey Jake,

Absolutely! Don't worry about this weekend; I got it covered because I was heading out of town.
The shift is usually super chill, so it should be pretty enjoyable. If you have any questions, just let me know or email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your concerns.

Thanks so much,
Ethan

    Hey,

    As an addendum to that, I will not be able to take that shift this weekend, so that would take effect starting on the 9th.

    Jake

        Hey Ethan,

        Sorry I didn't get in touch with you right away about this, but Alex told me you'd be willing to pass off your Saturday 10-2 shift? If you're still down to do that, I would be really grateful. Let me know!

        Thanks,
        Jake Degler
