Hey everyone,
 
Just a reminder that the philanthropy/social committee meeting is tonight at 7 PM in the main lounge. 
 
I told you that I would keep you posted on the formation of an ISRC group for the MLK Day of Service, and now, I am happy to inform you that Claire Morley has agreed to lead a group of ISRC residents for the event.  When you register, just put "ISRC" when it asks if you're part of a group.  Once again, I've included the information about the event below for your reference.
 
Hope to see you tonight!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
 
 
Northwestern's annual MLK day of service

You can volunteer with a group or individually. Since everyone has the day off, this would be a great way to give back and bond with your Northwestern peers! Need another incentive? Breakfast and lunch is included! The event is January 21st from 9am-2pm so tell your friends and sign up at: http://www.norris.northwestern.edu/csi/community/

All you need to bring is a good attitude, a smile, and an appetite! Please contact me if you have any further questions at (847)491-2350 orjessica.chiu@northwestern.edu. Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you all there!
