Hi everyone!

Would anyone be interested in picking up a few extra shifts during the reading week?  My reading week is basically like my final exam week b/c all of my classes scheduled early tests/papers.

Let me know if you can do either:

Monday 6-8 pm, or Thursday 10 pm -12 am

If not, that's fine too, but I just wanted to put it out there!
