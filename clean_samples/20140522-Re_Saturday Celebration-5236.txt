Hey guys,

I've received responses from some of you. Let me know by the end of today if you would like to go. Thanks!

    Hey guys,

    So since we don't have practice this Saturday, some of us were thinking of going to get some KBBQ to celebrate the end of the KASA Show as well as just getting together one last time for fun.

    Let me know if you want to come for this and if either lunch or dinner would work better this Saturday.

    Thanks,
    Davin
