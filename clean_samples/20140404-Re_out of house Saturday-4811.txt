Alex Yang and I will both be working at that time, so we were planning on one of us going with him since the sheets didn't show any events for Saturday.  Sorry about the miscommunications.  Saturday is all covered.

    Yes- Out Da box is a Pick-up.  We will need one more tech to work with Max.  It’s a big set up.

    I think we all got confused on what event you were talking about (there is an out-of-house with no description from 6AM-8PM on shiftplanning).  Max Zhang has the GlobeMed event Saturday 7:30-11:30PM the whole time.  That is covered.  Is Out Da Box in the morning still just a pickup?

        Tim,

        There is an AV for Out Da Box.  However there is a Delivery for Globe Med.  I had sent an additional AV board out on Wednesday morning. 

        Please see attachment for info.

        Hi Michael,

         

        We were confused about this event at the meeting because on the AV board it just said "AV pickup" so we assumed we didn't need to schedule anyone for the event. Could you let us know what times we need to schedule people for delivery, set up, and tear down? Do we need to schedule someone for the entire event? Thanks for your help, and sorry for the confusion.

            Hey Alex,

            I didn’t see anyone on the out of house for Saturday.  Did that get scheduled?  We will need 2 tech’s for delivery and set up.
