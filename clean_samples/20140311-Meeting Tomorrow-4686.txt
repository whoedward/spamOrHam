Hi everyone,

We're having our last meeting this quarter at a location TBA from 7-8pm. We will be doing shift coverages for Finals Week, so please make sure you know when your finals are, when you're leaving etc. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your reason along with any shifts that you need to get covered, as well as your availability for Finals Week.

Thanks,
