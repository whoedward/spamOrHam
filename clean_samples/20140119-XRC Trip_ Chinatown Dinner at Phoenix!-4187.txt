    Hello ISRCers!

    Sorry my email is a little late, but so worth the wait. I've got another set of tickets for you guys! This event takes you to dinner at the famous Phoenix Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in Chicago. A fancy bus will pick you up outside ISRC, take you to tastytown, and bring you back. We only have 6 tickets, so respond quickly!


    The Event:
     

     

    Friday, January 31 -  RC Dinner at the Phoenix in Chinatown

    If you are interested in going on the trip, here is what you should do!

        Read the Cross-College ticket policy attached and make sure that  you understand and accept the policy (the payment part will be applicable for future events)
        Email me by this WEDNESDAY (the 22nd) if you want to go on either trip. I will let you know if there are tickets still available. If you want to go to the dinner, tell me your entree preference
        Give me the money to reserve your spot no later than Monday, January 27th (under my door in a sealed envelope with your name or in person).
        If you have any questions, send me an email whenever and I will answer them. My email address is cb228@u.northwestern.edu
        Wait for an email from Nancy Anderson with further details. 


    The trips are incredibly fun and they are a great, easy way to get into Chicago and see things you wouldn't otherwise see. ALL TRANSPORTATION IS PROVIDED, and when you have paid for your ticket, Nancy Anderson will send you an email with all the details about the trip (i.e. where to meet to get on the bus, etc.) 

    You can pay me in person, or you can put your payment in an envelope with your name on it and slide it under my ISRC office door (first floor, by the boys' side). 

    I hope you all take this opportunity at least once per quarter! 
    I look forward to hearing from you, and have a great weekend!

    Best,

    Cheryl 
    Your Illustrious Assistant Master
