Hey Everyone,
 
The club basketball team is hosting a Krispy Kreme Fundraiser to try to raise some money for us to make it to a national tournament.
 
If you know that would like some donuts, pre-orders are $7/dozen.
If you're not sure, but might, orders the day-of are $8/dozen.
If you would like a few (but not a dozen), individual donuts are $1 each.
 
Pick-up will be on March 7th, 2014 somewhere on campus.
 
Please let me know if you are/might be interested in ordering Krispy Kreme donuts (aka doughnuts, if you prefer). Please see the attached flyer for pricing and pickup information.
 
Thanks for your help!
 
Enjoy,
Harry
