    Hi all,
    You should be receiving this e-mail because you got a spot for the Hoosier Mama pie social! (congrats!)

    ! !!

    Alright, we'll be meeting at 5 in the main lounge, I'll do a roll call of sorts and if someone doesn't show up, I'll notify our sole occupant on the waitlist. Related, if you find you cannot attend, please notify me so I can clear that waitlist. 
    We'll be leaving fairly promptly! It may or may not rain so please plan accordingly. I estimate that we'll get back to ISRC at around 7 pm. It's a long day for us IM players (i appreciate you guys soooo much though). 
    Again, my phone number is 334-750-9141, please have this number in case of any emergency of any sort.

    I'll see y'all tomorrow!! Hope the quarter's going well, and if it's not, hope pie tomorrow makes it better :<
