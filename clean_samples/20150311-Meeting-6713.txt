Dear Supervisors,

I will not be able to make it to the meeting today. I have to go into chicago to do research for one of my final papers. I will be unavailable Thursday/Friday but I can do the closing shift on Saturday or any other (preferably 4 hour) shift from Saturday to Tuesday.

All the best,
Juan Herrera
