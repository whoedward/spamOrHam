Hey!

This Thursday (October 9th) at 6pm, there will be a fellows social at Lao Sze Chuan (Southern Chinese food) with our lovely fellows!

There are 10 spots open, so I will send out an email at 8pm tonight and the first 10 people to respond will get a spot.

So...look out for that email at 8pm and email me back for a spot!

Go 'cats,
Coretta
