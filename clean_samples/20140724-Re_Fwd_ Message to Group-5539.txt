Sorry for the late response! I am on board. Do I need to Venmo someone?
As for what I can contribute, I haven't updated the list yet, but I have:
-flatscreen tv + vcr cabinet thing
-pots and pans and baking sheets
-kitchen utensils + cookware
-eating utensils
-four plates
-four glasses
-Good Housekeeping cookbook
-dish towels
-lamp
-wastebasket
-electric coffee maker
I can either bring these things in August if Mike has room to store them.
Or: my mom can bring these things the week of September 8 or the following week.
So, Mike, lmk if you have space (I can send you a picture of how much space this stuff takes up.)
