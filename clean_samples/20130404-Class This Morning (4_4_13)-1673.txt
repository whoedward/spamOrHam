Hello Professors,

First of all, I hope that you had very relaxing Spring breaks. Second, I wanted to ask your forgiveness for this morning's absence. To make a long story short, I think that I ate some fairly awful piscatory comestibles yesterday in our very own dining halls. I realize that this is not an official excuse and I do not expect any sort of leniency in terms of responsibility. I merely wanted you to know that I was not simply disregarding your wonderful class.

With that said, I hope that you will please let me know if there is anything that I need to do to make up for my absence (reading, emailing, etc.), or any information that I might need that would help me to catch up (although I hope that you guys did not get too far ahead in just one class period).

Thank you very much for your patience,
Ethan Robison
