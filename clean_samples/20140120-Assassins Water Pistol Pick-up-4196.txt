Greetings my assassins!

Your water pistols have all been tested, and are ready for pick-up! I will be in the main lounge tonight from 9-9:30 pm. It's a first-come, first-serve policy for water pistols, so if you can't make it that time, you can get someone else to pick up your water pistol. If you can't make it this time at all, send me an e-mail, and we can work something out.

Rules for the game will be sent out soonish.

Thomas
