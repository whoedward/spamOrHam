    Actually, Phoebe, things have changed a little bit due to a scheduling conflict that came up with me. Michael Wang has the 5-6 p.m. shift, and Andrew was supposed to take it from there.
    So... Now he needs the 6 to 9:30 shift. Sorry about the confusion!

        Hey Andrew,

        I checked the ryan event sheet again and your shift is only from 5-7 b/c Ethan is taking over from 7-end so.. i'll take your 5-7 :)
