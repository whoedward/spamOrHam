Hello Senpai,

Sorry about any delays associated with Aikido Club goings-on.
Considering my responsibilities as a student, and also the requisite actions that I have neglected to undertake in a sufficient and timely manner; I am sorry to say that I feel that the Aikido Club at Northwestern should be reconsidered as no longer possible.

Granted, I cannot guarantee that other students will not be interested in maintaining the club, but I personally cannot commit to the club's responsibilities.

Hopefully this will not come between any of us. I would certainly like to join any of you at Shinjinkai or on the mats in Blomquist if you are in town.

Best,
Ethan
