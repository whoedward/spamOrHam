Hi everyone,

I hope all is well and that the middle of the quarter isn't too stressful!

I know there a few people who can't make the sunday morning practice and there may be some people who want an additional practice during the week. I would like to get a count of people for whom this is true.

So...
If you would like to be practicing, but can't make Sunday morning reply to this email with:
1) I want to do BJJ but can't make Sunday morning practice!

If you would come to a practice during the week only and not on Sunday reply:
2) I would practice during the week, but not Sunday! (and explain if it is either because you can't make it sunday morning, or because you don't want to practice twice a week.)

If you would come to a practice during the week AND on Sunday reply:
3) I can't get enough of this stuff and would practice twice a week!

Thanks,
Jacob
