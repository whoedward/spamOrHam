Hello Alex,

I have my orgo lab on Wednesdays from 6-10 p.m. I am not sure whether or not this is still the time at which we will be having our weekly meetings, but if it is, I clearly cannot make it to any of them. I just thought that I ought to inform you of this, as I was a little late in updating the schedule.
