Hi!

Sorry to startle you with that. To let you know, your name is on http://northwesternformularacing.com/roster/ as one of the team leads, and if one searches the NU directory, you pop right up. Hopefully that's not too weird for you haha.

Best,
Ethan R.

    Good afternoon! 
    While I don't mind corresponding (and just sent an email to our Project Manager asking for the correct information to answer your queries), where did you get my email as a contact for FSAE?

        Hi Kody,

        I am Ethan Robison with the McCormick Student Advisory Board (MSAB). We're hoping to improve the student group experience for McCormick students and also to help them network. With that in mind, I'd like to get in touch with you and your group members.

        We have initiatives in place for everything from publicized event calendars to standardized funding models (all sorts of good stuff), and we're looking to improve the communication and collaboration between your group and MSAB.

        There are just a few things that we're looking for:
        - Contact information for your president and treasurer
        - Any website URLs that you might have (facebook, wordpress, or otherwise)
        - Event dates for recruiting, info sessions, or other cool happenings

        And, most importantly, please let me know of anything in your experience as a student group that you would like changed. That's what we're here for.

        Best,
