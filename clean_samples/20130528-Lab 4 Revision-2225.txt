Ethan,

1) There is something you can do. At the end of Lab 4, where it asks us to find other interesting Poincare Sections, please do that. Find at least 5-10 other sections.
2) Please revise this very carefully. I cannot stress this enough. My advice is to have the syllabus next to you as you revise and make absolutely sure that we answered everything in the lab that it asked us to do. I have attached the lab and the lab syllabus.

Also, please come to EA 4 tomorrow.

From,
Michael Wang
