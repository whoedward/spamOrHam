Hi NTS,

Here are the notes from last night's meeting

Announcements

We are starting to get more new equipment to replace some of the old stuff we had, so if you see something that you can't set up, don't hesitate to ask us or Michael for help.

There are late closes both Friday and Saturday. If all of the tech on the sheets are done and you want to go home, make sure you inform the CM and then you can leave early.

Shift Coverages

Christina Sat 8am-10am ------> Jake T.
John Thurs 4pm-6pm ---------> Tim W.
Tim W. Sun 6-8pm -------> Andrew J

Here's the Google Doc for Ryan events

Keep up the good work!

Alex
