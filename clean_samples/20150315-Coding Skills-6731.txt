Hi Mom!

Here is a general list of my various skills (languages are in order of experience):

Web Development:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- BootStrap, nodejs, angular

Scripting & Compiled Languages:
- Python
- C++
- SQL
- Ruby
- Visual Basic
- Java
- Bash
- C

I also have experience with distributed version control systems like git and Mercurial. I am familiar with Subversion as well.

I have experience with publishing software and with Microsoft Office and OpenOffice suites.

I work equally well on OSX, Windows, and Linux operating systems.


Hopefully that's enough information. Ask Mr. Hammann if he needs anything else.
Thanks so much!

Love,
