Hi Will,

As you can tell, I've missed yet another shift today. I'll be requesting a transfer from the Saturday open at the next meeting, but if I can't get it, I'll just have to buckle down and figure out how to wake up. Hopefully I can be forgiven. If not, I understand.

Sincerest apologies (yet again),

Ethan
