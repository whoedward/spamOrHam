Chris,

I noticed on the grid under "Check Projector" it says something about logging hours. What does that mean?

Also, I noticed that you want the mic batteries to be replaced during checking if they're 1 bar or less. Does this new rule also apply for events (in the past, we've been doing 2 bars or less for events)?

From,
Michael Wang
