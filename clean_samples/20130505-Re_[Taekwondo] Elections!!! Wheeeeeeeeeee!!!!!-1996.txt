P.P.S.  I expect everyone to be there for the voting whether you intend to be in leadership or not. This is my final request from you as President. :)

    Hey everyone,

    Now that KASA is over and we're a little over halfway through Spring Quarter, it's time to discuss elections for next year's leadership! Wheeeeeee!

    So the way we're going to do this is that on Monday, 8 PM, at Blomquist we're going to nominate and elect people to become next year's Presidents and Treasurer. Self nominations count, too. This way, in case no one wants my job, I can always nominate someone and force him or her to take it... lol

    Anyways, please be at Blomquist on time for this. We've still got to warm up for practice and all, so if we're late for arrival, we'll be late with warm ups, and we'll be unprepared by the time Kallo comes to train us.

    There will also be a few changes to the leadership positions. Two years ago, the presidents before me decided to change the structure of the leadership from having two co-presidents and one treasurer into having one president, one vice president, and one treasurer. The result of this was that all the former presidential responsibilities remained with the president, and no clear responsibilities were given for the vice president. I personally believe that the primary reason this failed was because the sports club administration at Northwestern only acknowledges the treasurer and presidential positions, so in terms of requesting funding, managing events, etc. only the president and treasurer's signature were recognized.

    So instead of having a presidential postion recognized by the Sports Club Administration and a vice presidential position that is not, we'll have two co-presidents who both have recognition.

    Here are the responsibilities of each position. The next year's presidents can split their responsibilities as they like, but from my experience, this is what I recommend:

    President #1:
    - general club management (you'll be the "go to" guy for non-monetary things related to the club)
    - paperwork (reserve practice space once per quarter, quarterly reports for the sports club director, and other paperwork I seem to occasionally forget)
    - attend sports club president meetings (once per quarter)
    - manage relationship with BTMA
    - manage regular practice warm ups
    - manage the listserv and send emails like this one

    Treasurer (the one and only):
    - EVERYTHING money related (paying instructors, manage SOFO account, buying equipment, handling club dues, etc.)
    - attend treasurer meetings (once per quarter?)
    - manage the listserv and send emails

    President #2:
    - handle start of the year club recruitment (booth at activities fair, flyering, etc)      (Fall Quarter)
    - organize trips to other tournaments                                                                 (Fall Quarter)
    - prepare for that Winter Quarter belt test tournament in Patten                           (Winter Quarter)
    - organize demonstrations (such as Kellogg demo and KASA Show demo)          (Spring Quarter)
    - manage regular practice warm ups
    - listserv and email stuff

    The reason I split the presidential responsibilities the way I did is that responsibilities for the president will surge at different points of the year for larger events such as upcoming tournaments or demonstrations. One president will continue to handle the usual responsibilities while the other will handle the big events that occur every year. Finally, these positions are independent of belt rank. Don't think that you are not qualified for any of these positions because you are not a black belt.

    After the elections, Allan will train the next year's treasurer and I will train the next year's presidents in their new responsibilities. Don't be intimidated by the positions. Everyone from this year's leadership will still be around next year, and we're all here to help. Especially Alex. He doesn't have a formal position so I feel like sometimes he doesn't get as much recognition as he deserves, but he's super reliable so I highly recommend the next year's leadership to count on him for just about anything.

    See you all on time on Monday!

    P.S. Can we get those KASA demos up on Youtube as soon as possible? I know you've got a recording of it, too, Mr. Super Dependent Alex Peroff
