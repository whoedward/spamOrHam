Dear Student,

We are writing to you from the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid to notify you that your 2013-14 University Aid Application (UAPP) is now available via CAESAR for completion.

You can access your UAPP and view your other application requirements for the 2013-14 academic year on your To-Do List (CAESAR > Main Menu > Student Financial Services > To Do Items). 

The deadline for all reapplication materials is May 1, 2013.  A complete 2013-14 financial aid application consists of:

 	2013-14 University Aid Application (UAPP)
 	2013-14 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
 	2013-14 CSS Profile
 	Additional information (may be required as determined on a case-by-case basis) 

We will review the files in the order the application materials are received and students will be notified when awards are available to review in CAESAR beginning in mid-June.  All students who have applied by the May 1 deadline will receive an aid decision by mid-July.

Please contact our office if you do not plan to apply for financial aid for the 2013-14 academic year or if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Financial Aid Committee
