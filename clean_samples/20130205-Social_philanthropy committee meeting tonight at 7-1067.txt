Hey everyone,
 
As usual, the social/philanthropy committee meeting will be tonight at 7.  Right after the meeting will be Professor Alec Klein's fireside.  Please try to show up to the committee meeting on time so Alec can start his fireside right after the meeting.
 
See you tonight!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
