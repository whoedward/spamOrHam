Hello good residents of ISRC,

Next weekend, on Saturday, March 8th, we'll be going on a social to the Eataly Market. (Sorry to you DMers.) Here's the website for Eataly so you can see all the cool stuff they have. 

www.eataly.com (shocking right?)

So, we'll cover a panini, focaccia, or some other sandwich that's about $10 and desert treat for each person. There might be some things you want to get on your own, too. You can cover your own transportation. We'll be taking the Red Line down.

There will be 12 slots available. I'll send out the email at 4:00 pm this Sunday.

Let me know if you have any questions.

--Jonas
