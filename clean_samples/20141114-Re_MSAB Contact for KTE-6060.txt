Hi Ethan,
 
I am the president for KTE. The other exec member is Nick Brandis: nicholasbrandis2015@u.northwestern.edu
 
Our website: http://kte.mccormick.northwestern.edu/
 
Events: we tentatively have a mentorship kickoff planned for the winter however details are TBD. I'll keep you posted. Likely we would love to have you publicize our event in your calendars once we have the details sorted out :)
 
Thanks for your help!
 
Best,
Paige

    Hi Paige,

    I am Ethan Robison with the McCormick Student Advisory Board (MSAB). We're hoping to improve the student group experience for McCormick students and also to help them network. With that in mind, I'd like to get in touch with you and your group members.

    We have initiatives in place for everything from publicized event calendars to standardized funding models (all sorts of good stuff), and we're looking to improve the communication and collaboration between your group and MSAB.

    There are just a few things that we're looking for:
    - Contact information for your president and treasurer
    - Any website URLs that you might have (facebook, wordpress, or otherwise)
    - Event dates for recruiting, info sessions, or other cool happenings

    And, most importantly, please let me know of anything in your experience as a student group that you would like changed. That's what we're here for.

    Best,
