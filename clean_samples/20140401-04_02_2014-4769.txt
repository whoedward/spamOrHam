Hey, everyone,

Just a reminder that we have normal practice today. Master Kallo will actually be coming to teach us tomorrow, so just a heads up for that. Also, remember that we're going to try to set aside the last 30 minutes of practice for the KASA Show preparation.

One last thing, before we practice for KASA, I just wanted to have a brief but important meeting with everyone to just get some feedback about our current instruction from BTMA and any suggestions or desires for improvement.

See you all tomorrow.

Yours,
Davin
