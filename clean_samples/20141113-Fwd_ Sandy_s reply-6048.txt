I like Sandy’s willingness to take full blame.  However the blame is shared by her and Max.  Please print out the emails sent to Max and Sandy and their respective replies and give me a hard copy for their files. 

I think their Reponses are heartfelt and the incident was a coincidence.  However, please still plan to have a sit down with both of them and explain the stress that was impacted upon the CM, Dan and Justin this morning.

 

Thanks,

 

Michael
