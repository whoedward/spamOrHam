Hey guys,

    I want to thank everyone who did concessions at the Ohio State game. For those who did work that game, could you please email me with a list of things that you felt worked, and a list of things that you felt did not work?
    Why do I want this information? I'm glad you asked. I want this information because I think that it is important for us to raise funds for the club, and I am hoping that we might be able to work concessions at at least one more game this season. This would help offset costs of dues, or help to pay for testing, or something. For whatever reason, however, having money is essential for our club.
    Other than doing concessions, I would also really appreciate it if people could come up with other ways that we might be able to do fundraising. 
    Now other than fundraising... I know that we haven't ordered clothing in a while (the sweatshirts are older than the present seniors, as far as I can tell...) and I wanted to know what type of clothing people would be both wanting of, and willing to buy.

Thanks.

Have a great weekend, and Go 'Cats

Joanna
