Hey Ya!

Come out and support you RC at RCB FIELD DAY! Fight for its glory!

Compete in events like the human-sized foosball bracket, a tug of war, and the Masters Mile and the PIE EATING CONTEST. Only one RC can take home the coveted trophy, but EVERY RC RESIDENT can have a great time, get FREE FOOD AND SWAG and win RAFFLE PRIZES at the event. You've probably already won something!

Also: earn points for your RC by "liking" the RCB Facebook page and voting for your RC in the Popularity Contest! If you do both, your name will be entered in a drawing for one of two $50 Amazon.com gift cards. 

MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
