Hey guys,

Feedback Forums are happening in all dining locations on campus, and we need student input for Norrisâ€™ forum. It is taking place this Wednesday November 19 from 5-6 in the TGP Alcove, and food will be included.

We need about 8 people so if you are available at this time to come, please let me know ASAP.
