Rehearsal Notes:

    We had an awesome first run through! We did a longer warm-up than usual, which really helped everyone get focused, and it showed in the run through. The pacing worked well, and there were only a few problem spots in terms of blocking.
    We had a hefty notes session at the end of the run through, and will need to work a few spots during our next rehearsal. In terms of pacing, it feels like the show is in a very good place. We have a few transitions to work out, but in general pacing was good and the individual acts were cohesive.
    The run through clocked in at about 2 hours. Act I is 1:20 mins, Act II roughly 40 mins.

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    None today!

Costume Notes:

    We need to talk about two brief moments with Emily’s characters—she is Cinna the Poet being chased across the stage at the beginning of Act II, which we added recently. Her body is then carried across the stage at the beginning of scene 5.3
    We can discuss things more extensively/specifically tomorrow before the prod meeting.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    None today!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Hope to see you all tonight!
