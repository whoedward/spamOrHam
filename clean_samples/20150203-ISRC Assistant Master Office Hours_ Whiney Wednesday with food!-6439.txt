Hi ISRCers,

I'll be hosting two weekly events starting this Wednesday (today!) with Whiney Wednesdays. Feel free to drop by and see me from 2 - 4p in my office (first floor of ISRC). Come eat meats, cheeses, and drink (non-alcoholic) wine while whining about your week with me! BYOG (bring your own glassware)

The two weekly events for winter quarter will be:

    Tuesday Teas at 12 (12 - 2p in my office): come eat cookies, drink tea/coffee with me! BYOM (bring your own mug)
    Whiney Wednesdays (2 - 4p in my office): come eat meats, cheeses, and drink (non-alcoholic) wine while whining about your week with me! BYOG (bring your own glassware)

Thanks,

Jen Guoâ€‹, ISRC Assistant Master
