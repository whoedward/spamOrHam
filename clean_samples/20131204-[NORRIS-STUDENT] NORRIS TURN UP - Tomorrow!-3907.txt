Hey guys,

If you haven't yet heard, we're having a Norris staff holiday bash TOMORROW! Prizes include five $20 gift cards to some of your favorite places and NORTHWESTERN WINTER GEAR. Must make a holiday ornament to enter the raffle. Be sure to come dressed to enter our UGLY SWEATER CONTEST, eat some good food, drink some cider, and amaze everyone with your karaoke skills.  

See ya there and be sure to spread the word to your fellow staffers!
Bria
