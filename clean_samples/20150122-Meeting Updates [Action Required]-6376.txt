Hello Everyone,

First off I want to congratulate Jane Miller and Brennan Jackson as they will serve as the co-chairs of MSAB for the upcoming academic year!!

Secondly, as we have been having massive scheduling conflicts with many of the members, please fill out this whenisgood if you have not already (http://whenisgood.net/293m3z2).  I will email you individually to follow up if it is not completed by tomorrow evening.

Best,
Jason
