Hi everyone, here are the notes from our first meeting tonight.

Schedule:

This is the link to the tentative schedule for the next few weeks. We are still missing availability from a few people, so once that comes in you can expect a revision to the schedule.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdHRibVR4TzJZZHdEMTU0V2Uwd3JhX0E&usp=sharing

This schedule is effective next Monday. Please check your schedule and show up to your shifts!

Shifts highlighted in yellow either still need coverage or are only temporarily covered. If you can take any of the those shifts please tell us.

Your shifts will change once we get new hires in, so you're not going to be working this many shifts the entire quarter.

If you have any conflicts or complaints about the schedule, email me and we'll get them sorted out.

Shiftplanning:

We are starting to transition to using the Shiftplanning application to schedule. As of right now, you should all have either made your account on Shiftplanning or received a link to do so from Michael. If you do not have the link or cannot make an account, contact us and Michael and we'll get that sorted out.

Once you're on, make sure to set your availability through your profile and set your notifications so the system doesn't send you an email for every little thing that happens. This should have finding open shifts/trading shifts much easier. It should also streamline our scheduling for the future.


Ryan Events:

We are planning to transition our coverage of Ryan events onto a different team of student workers. This will happen sometime during the quarter. However, we are still in charge of Ryan in the interim. There will probably be people shadowing Ryan events during the transition, as a heads up.


Hope you guys have a good start to the quarter!

Alex
