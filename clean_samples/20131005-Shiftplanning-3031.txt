Hey Guys,

I'm not sure who filled out the stuff for shiftplanning today but on shiftplanning it says that Max is working my 2pm-4pm tomorrow. I didn't trade shifts with him and it still says that I'm working that shift on the meeting notes from Thursday, so just wondering if that was changed on purpose or if I should still work that shift. Thanks!
