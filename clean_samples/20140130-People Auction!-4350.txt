Hello, lovely ISRCers!

The ISRC People Auction is a DM fundraiser in which you all can donate talents or services (examples: music lessons, food delivery, grocery shopping, essay editing, cookie baking, cooking lessons, language lessons, manicures, massages, makeup tutorials, prank calls, DVDs on loan, etc.) that will be auctioned off to anyone who likes the ISRC People Auction Facebook page.  

First step: Like this facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction

Second step: Invite your friends to like the page. 

Third step: Look though the 2013 Auction Listings photo album for more ideas on what you can donate. https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.557677827576523.131165.551776534833319&type=3
And through the very few auction listings already in the 2014 photo album.

Fourth step: Email me if you want to donate something! I will take your ISRC photo roster picture, upload it to the album, and fill in your info.

Fifth step: Start bidding!  Bid by commenting on the photos.

I don't know when the auction will close - probably in around 2 weeks. The more people who donate talents/services, the better!  ALL the money goes to DM. Email me if you have any questions.  Thank you all so, so much!!!!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
