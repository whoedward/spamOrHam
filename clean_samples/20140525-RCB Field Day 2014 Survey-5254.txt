Hello RC residents,

I hope that you had a great time at RCB Field Day 2014!!! The weather was excellent, and I doubt that we could have had a better location than Northwestern’s beautiful Lakeville. 

I’m attaching a survey for those of you who attended the event. Please fill it out when you have the time. It shouldn’t take more then 3 minutes. This will help to make next year’s Field Day better. 

I had a good time planning this event and an even better time seeing how much fun you guys had.

I look forward to planning smaller events for each of your RCs and helping your IM teams to do well.

Thanks for everything.

Your RCB VP of ICR,
Philip Hawkyard
