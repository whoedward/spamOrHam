Hi NTS, 

Announcements

All events need to be set up at least 1 hour before the event start time. 

We are starting a new system of initialing the sheets for every event setup/teardown. At the end of the day, the closing shift will put the sheets back into the cubbie in the office downstairs. 

Some cables have been moved to the back room. The bigger cables for larger events are stored back there, and if you see any cords that are falling off, please coil them and put them in the back room.
