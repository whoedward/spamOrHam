Hello, lovely ISRCers!!!


The Zombie Walk at the EPL is fast approaching - it will be Friday, October 25, from approximately 6 to 8pm. In case you don't remember from my previous emails, it basically entails dressing up as zombies, walking with little kids around downtown, and then returning to the library for games and music by Banda Nueva Generacion (a local group). I need at least 5 people to volunteer to do zombie make-up at bit before 6pm that day. It will be super fun!!! (Disclaimer: you might have to do a separate make-up training session, but if you do, you will get 2 philanthropy points, not 1.) After you do make-up on that Friday, if you want to stay for the actual walk, you can! And if you want to come walk but not do make-up, you can do that, too! I just need people to RSVP BY THIS WEDNESDAY if you want to do make-up and/or walk. Thanks, guys! Happy Monday!


ISRClove,

Ayla
