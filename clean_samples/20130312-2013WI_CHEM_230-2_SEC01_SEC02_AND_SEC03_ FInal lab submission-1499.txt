Hello all,

I hope your studies are going well. Just wanted to say that tomorrow your final lab will be due to me at 6pm in the organic lab tutor room. I will be in the room from 6 to 6:30pm. If I dont receive it by then, its considered late and my policy from my syllabus kicks in. Now if you are done early and do not want to wait till 6. you can place the report in the folder with my name on it (at your risk) and also email me your completed report before hand so that you are accounted for the appropriate deadline.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. Otherwise I will see you tomorrow. It's been a pleasure being your TA.

Sincerely,
Cornelius
