Hi ISRC!

This is a reminder that today is the last day to submit services to the Service Auction! If you have not already, send me your services by midnight! 
Be sure to check out the Facebook page because bidding will start tomorrow at 8pm! 
For those of you on the DM team, remember that you must donate a service to have the money raised go to your personal fundraising! 
Thanks to all who are participating!

ISRClove,

Ellen
