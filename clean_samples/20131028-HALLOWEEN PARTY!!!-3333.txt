Hey everyone,

This deserves its own special e-mail. We will have a Halloween Party this Thursday in the Main Lounge and the basement from 8-10pm! There's going to be tons of fun with sideshow games (pin the bone on the skeleton, donut bobbing, pumpkin decorating, BOUNCY EYEBALL CIDER PONG, etc). We will be showing Halloween themed movies as well as a COSTUME CONTEST!!!
Categories include: best overall, scariest, funniest, and most creative. The prizes are AWESOME.

Come for the fun, stay for the...fun!
Thomas
