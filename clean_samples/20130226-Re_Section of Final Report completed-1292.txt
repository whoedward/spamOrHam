Ethan suggested holding 3 cups by pinching them at the top, in each hand of each runner, so one trip could get them all at once and quickly. Also good work getting your part done.

    Hey guys

    I just finished the section of the final report assigned to me; look it over if you have any concerns.

    Just a question; how will the runner carry over all twelve cups of fasteners to the building site at once? We don't have any method for transportation in our design, just pickup and organization, which I think could be a major design flaw.

    Thanks in advance,
    Will Krinsman
