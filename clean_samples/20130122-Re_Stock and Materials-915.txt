Hello Again,

Regarding specific materials, I am looking for extruded aluminum and brass rods, but square stock will be adequate, if round is unavailable.

Thanks again,
Ethan Robison

    Hey Ethan,

    Not sure exactly what materials you need but anything on the racks by the west
    windows is yours for DTC projects.  If you can't find anything suitable, just ask
    Joe or Bob to order from Mc Master for you.

    Hello Sir,

    I am emailing to inquire as to the procedure that one might follow to obtain shop materials (stock, etc.). In short, is there a sufficient supply available that I may simply use raw materials without prior approval or notice (within reason). If I may not, how might I go about ordering or garnering these items ahead of time? As well, what is regurarly available in the shop, if anything is?
    If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

    Many thanks,
    Ethan Robison
