Hello, my most lovely ISRCers!

Did you notice how I'm sucking up to you all more than normal? It's because I NEED YOU!!!! There's a Bake Sale this Monday (11/18) by the Rock from 8:30am-2pm. Here's how much I love you guys: it was going to be at the Rock AND Tech, but I'm not going to make anyone walk all the way up there. :) 

Half-hour shifts, half a philanthropy point each, sign up here: http://doodle.com/8hdh3k6iv5e7qxfd
 
I will help set-up at 8:30, but I could use more help, then selling stuff starts between 8:30 and 9, and cleaning up is from 1:30 to 2 (unless we sell out before then). Table and perhaps chairs will be provided. And advertising signs. 

Speaking of which: Help this weekend by baking or creating ads (online/on paper) for more philanthropy points!!! EMAIL ME TO HELP THIS WEEKEND! (I already have some awesome people signed on to bake, but I could use more.)

Email me if you have questions/suggestions.

So much ISRC-love,
Ayla
