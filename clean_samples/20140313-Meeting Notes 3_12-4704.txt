Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from yesterday's meeting

Announcements:

Shift Coverages should all be reflected in Shiftplanning - if you still have a shift you need covered, please release it shift on Shiftplanning and send out an email ASAP.

Please make sure you update your Spring availability by the end of Finals Week - we will send out an email for you to fill out your preferred shifts/hours soon.

If you are planning to stay on campus during Spring break and want to work, please contact Michael  - the shifts are pretty easy, but you will be paid out of your work-study allotment.

Thanks for a great quarter and good luck on finals!
