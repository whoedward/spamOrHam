Hello, lovely ISRC-ers,

I just wanted to let you all know that when Nathan sent out the email about Shrek the Musical, he meant to say that DM night is Friday, January 31, not this Friday (opening night).  This means that if ISRC has the highest attendance of all groups with a DM team on the 31st, our DM team will win serious money!  Also, I'm playing the flute for Shrek on Friday the 31st!  And it's the only night I'll be playing, since I'm subbing for a friend.  

So... buy your tickets below for Friday, January 31, at 8pm in Cahn!  Each ticket is between $5 and $20, depending on where you sit. (Normally it's $15-$30, but students get $10 off for pre-show sales.)

You'll be supporting Lucy, me, and DM, AND you'll have a great time!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
