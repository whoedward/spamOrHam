That was what I was thinking, although sometimes lists give me trouble in Prolog. You should see if you can figure that out. I bet that Horswill is going to dig this.

    Alternatively, we define the "uniqueness" rule for roles only, and then we add roles that are allowed to be held simultaneous: i.e.
    % Uniqueness rule here % :- C \= D, \+ simultaneous_roles(X, Y).

For example, I am adding a rule that says if a father follows a sacrificing kind of religion, then his son will also follow a sacrificing kind of religion, but that will then never get picked because of the uniqueness rule.

>>         Go ahead and scratch the multiple roles contradiction from your copies; unless we add an "approved" multiple list, that contradiction would prevent anyone from having any pair of roles (say, pastor and gas_station_patron). Let's just add unique rules to roles like sheriff and pastor.

Hypothetically we could do an "implies" on any role that calls the random generator function from solver.pl to pick another random role, but we'd have to be careful that we don't end up with a game where everyone is also a pastor or something like that.

>>>             Hey guys,
>>>
>>>             Here's the code. I've fixed and added a few things that you should check out and feel free to tweak or adjust heavily:
>>>             - the car tires thing is good
>>>             - adjusted the religions
>>>             - it's currently set so that only one person can have each role, we should decide how we feel about it (personally, I think that it will make things more interesting)
>>>             - it's also set so that only one person can have each need, for the same motivations as with the roles
>>>             - added a bunch of new roles, a few items, and a few needs
>>>             - added some implications and contradictions
>>>
>>>             Let me know your thoughts!
