Hey Supers,

Here's the things Ethan, Schlehuber, and I went over at the supers meeting this afternoon:

1. T-shirts are in and Dan and Bobby both said how fantastic they are.  We'll pass them out at the meeting tomorrow.
2. Tried to figure out what had happened to the speakers at the candlelight vigil last Thursday, but couldn't.
3. Going to send any missed swipes to Jenn.
4. New-hires seem to be doing well.
5. Going to ask at the meeting who doesn't have an out of house option on their swipe and tell Jenn.
6. Ethan will ask Dan tomorrow about AV Board.
7. Going to buy a thank you card for Dan since he's basically working 4 jobs right now.  Dan is getting a get-well card for Michael.
8. Mike, please send the training powerpoint to us to prepare for this weekend's training.


In other news, Shiftplanning is messed up: Tim caught that the Saturdays are really off.  For some reason Chen and Alex Z. have shifts but Tim is supposed to be on some of those.  We need to get a master list ASAP so we can figure out the schedule changes from Shiftplanning. Here are the shift records from the last two weeks: https://drive.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/?usp=docs_home#folders/0B_QIpwGAfXUpcGM5WnQ0MlAwNms
