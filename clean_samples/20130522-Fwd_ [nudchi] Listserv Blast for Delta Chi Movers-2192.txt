Hey ISRC!
If you're needing help moving out, Delta Chi has got you covered! Here's a message from our Philanthropy Chair:

(Check out our promo vid!)
Are you living in or storing your things in Evanston this summer? 
Do you need assistance packing up and transporting these things? 
Do you need help moving boxes, small furniture, and non-fragile items to your car so you can drive home at the end of the year? 

If your answer was "Yes!" to any of these questions, then you're in luck. Because we'd like to move it for you.

The sign-up process is quick and easy. Just visit http://deltachimovers.com/, pick a time-slot, and we'll do all the work. We provide the transportation and can move you out of your dormitory, Greek house, or apartment into a vehicle, your summer housing, or Evanston public storage facilities. Moves from your room to a vehicle or curb will be $20, and moves to a location in Evanston will be $40, with all proceeds going to The V Foundation for Cancer Research. 

Don't wait to sign up, as capacity is limited. Have a great last month of school, and happy moving!
