Hey everyone, 

We are nearing the end of the quarter, so this is a reminder of how the ISRC points system work! 

You need to be on at least 3rd list in fall AND winter quarters in order to live in ISRC next year, as well as to run for the Exec Board in winter. 

Currently, there is only one non-Exec member eligible to live here next year. You have two weeks to change that. STEP IT UP. 

Here is the points list: http://bit.ly/Sxa2BT (I update it within 24 hours of receiving attendance lists.) 

I have also attached a more detailed explanation of how the points system work, and why it matters. 

If you think you should have more points, please e-mail me. Ideally, we can resolve any issues over e-mail, but if not, I will be holding points appeal sometime during reading week. 

Lastly, if you have trouble getting a certain category of points for some reason, please let me know. We'll work something out. 

Thanks for reading to the end of the e-mail! 

Hannah
