        Hey everyone,

        I'll be presenting my senior design project tomorrow afternoon in Chicago at the client site and I don't know exactly when I'll be back so I really need to get this shift covered tomorrow. I would really appreciate it if someone could pick this up for me.

        Thanks,

        Fadhi
