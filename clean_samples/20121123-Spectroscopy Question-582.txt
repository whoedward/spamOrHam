Hello Dr. Priest,

First, I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Second, I have a question for you regarding spectroscopy. In compound number five of the intermediate set (http://www.chem.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/webspectra.cgi?Problem=ip5), the integrals on the H-NMR seem to go 1-1-1-2-3. If they do this, however, they do not match up with the solution, which would have 2-1-2-3. At least, that is how it seems that it would be to me. If you could please explain (or direct me to a source that could explain) this distribution, I would appreciate that very much.

Thank you,
Ethan Robison
