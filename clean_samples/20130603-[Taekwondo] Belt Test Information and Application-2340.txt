Hey everyone,

The forms for the belt test are attached to this email. Ignore the Application Due Date section. That does not apply to us. Turn in this form with the testing fee during the belt test.

The test is Wednesday in Blomquist at 8:45 PM. Make sure to come at least 15 minutes earlier to stretch and warm up.

Good luck to all testers! Sorry I couldn't be there for the last practice, but I guess that's what happens when I don't set my alarm before a nap. :P
