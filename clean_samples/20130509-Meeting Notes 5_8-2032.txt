Hi NTS,

Announcements -

Please remember to initial the sheets after every setup/teardown and make sure at least one sheet gets onto Michael's desk at the end of the day.

If you on a Ryan Event, make sure that the entire venue gets cleaned up - including trash between the seats etc. You can ask the client to help, but you need to make sure the venue is clean by the time you leave
