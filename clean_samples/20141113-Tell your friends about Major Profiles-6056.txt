MSABallers,

We are rolling out two new features: A one-page profile about each major on the MSAB website, and an event called "Live CTECs", where upperclassmen can chat to underclassmen about their McCormick experience over some free food.

If you know a student who is both involved in McCormick (preferably in their own major) and is willing to be interviewed for the website or talk about their McCormick experience to underclassmen, feel free to let us know.

All majors welcome!

From,
Michael Wang
