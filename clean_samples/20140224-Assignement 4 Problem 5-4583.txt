Hi Dr. Horswill,

Today at office hours I overheard you mentioning that problem five can be solved using the "map" function. Attached is my Assignment 4 .meta file with my solution to problem 5. I realize that there are many ways to skin a cat, and am confident in my answer, but I wanted to know if there was a "better" way to go about solving number 5. 

That said, how exactly would one use map to do number 5? For the life of me, I cannot figure it out.

Regards,
