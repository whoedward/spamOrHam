Hi Everyone,

Considering that Norris will be open 24 hours this week, I wanted to emphasize that it is vital for each shift to be sweeping the building throughout the day and that closing shifts be extra careful about leftover equipment. 

People will be in and out of rooms constantly for study spaces and equipment can sometimes be turned on, borrowed and left behind, or potentially even stolen if events are not cleaned up. 

Thanks in advance and I hope everyone has a smooth finals week.
