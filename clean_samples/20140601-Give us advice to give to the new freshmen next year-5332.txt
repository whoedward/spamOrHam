Hey ISRC,

You know I love spreadsheets and forms create spreadsheets with the responses, so YAY!

We want to make a freshman guide for next year and as part of it, we thought it'd be cool to have a section with advice from all of you for them to read on academic stuff, social stuff and how to do college stuff. Please take the time to fill this out :)
