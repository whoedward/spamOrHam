Hey Ethan,

Michael wanted me to let you know that there is a Ryan event tonight during your shift at Norris. So by 7:30 PM, please go to Ryan auditorium and you'll meet David there. Take the Ryan auditorium key from the info desk~~ You just make sure he sets up everything right and then you can come back to Norris. Maybe give David your number so he can reach you if something isn't working.

Thanks!

Phoebe
