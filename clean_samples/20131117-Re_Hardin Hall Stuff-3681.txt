Yep!  Just need to turn the power strip on the bottom of the cart on and then all the mics.  I think Boss Mike may be there tomorrow morning too.  is that the shift you can take?

            Hey supers,

            So we misunderstood the shifts required for this Hardin Hall thing, and these are the shifts:

            Monday 8:30-9:30 am
            Monday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
            Tuesday 8:30-9:30 am - Christina
            Tuesday noon-1:30 pm - Ethan
            Tuesday 3-5 PM - Big Mike & 

            Currently I am on the Monday morning on Shiftplanning, but I technicallyyyy have class I should go to.  Is anyone able?
            We just need that and someone to help tear down with Big Mike on Tuesday.  The set-up is a snake from their system into our mixer with four wireless kits.  Super simple.

            Thanks, guys!
