Hello Alex,

This is just a follow-up email so there's a record of our talk tonight. From now on, please make sure you are not leaving shift more than 10 minutes early and inform the other person on shift the reason for leaving early. If this behavior continues, we will have to issue a formal warning.

Thanks,

Alex Yang
