Hello all you amazing people,

We will be rotating warm ups among the black belts soon. What that means is that a different black belt will lead the warm ups before the instructors come each practice. The process is simple: You volunteer to lead warm ups as part of the rotation, and when the rotation comes to you, you lead the warm ups that day. You can choose just to do the stretching or, if you'd like, also lead drills for the duration before the instructors arrive.

Normally, we handle this on the black belt listserv. Yes, there is a black belt listserv. No, it is not as exclusive as you think. We used it last year to handle the rotations because you can't reply all on this listserv without administrator privileges, and putting people on and swapping people out of the rotation would be very difficult to do otherwise.

So if you're a black belt and you're not already on the black belt listserv (I think that's everyone who is a black belt and joined this year), tell me and I will add you. Then, volunteer to lead warm ups. It's good leadership experience, and having a different person lead warm ups each time keeps things fresh.

Also, if you aren't a black belt and want to be on that listserv anyways, I'll be more than happy to add you because inclusiveness is awesome.

Ji-hoon
