Hey Miranda,

Hope you've had a good school year so far.  I'm contacting you on behalf of the UNITY Charity Fashion Show regarding cultural clothing.  We were wondering if you have or have access to cultural clothing either from ISRC or other international student groups.  Sorry this is a little rushed since our show is this Sunday.

If you can let me know as soon as possible that would be great!

Thanks!!!

Sincerely,
Jason
