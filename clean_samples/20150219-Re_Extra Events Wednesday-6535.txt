    Hey guys,

    On the new AV Board there are two equipment deliveries on Wednesday.

    1) Deliver small pwrd speaker & stand to Block Museum at 4:30; clean up 8:30
    2) Deliver prjctr screen & prjctr to Great Room at 5; clean up 8

    Can anyone do setups?  I have class that whole time.  I figure that we can just recruit people after the meeting for cleanups.
