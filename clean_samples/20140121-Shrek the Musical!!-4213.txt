Hi everyone! Make sure you all buy your tickets for SHREK the Musical. One of our residents, the lovely Lucy Kalar, is assistant stage managing the show, which is the largest student-run theatrical production in the United States of America. Plus, if our residential college has high attendance on opening night (THIS FRIDAY!!), we can win some cash towards our ISRC Dance Marathon team. I encourage all of you to go and experience what NU student theatre has to offer.

See the info below for details on how to buy tickets, show times, and other important bits of knowledge!


ISRC-Love,

Nathan

Proudly Presents
SHREK THE MUSICAL

PURCHASE TICKETS NOW AT
NUDOLPHINSHOW.ORG/TICKETS!

SHREK THE MUSICAL, based on the 2001 Dreamworks film and the 1990 book Shrek! by William Steig, debuted
on Broadway in December 2008. SHREK tells the story of a swamp-living, bug-eating ogre and his journey to save
a princess from an isolated tower. Along the way, Shrek encounters characters straight from our favorite fairytales
and nursery rhymes while making new friends, experiencing  new adventures, and finding true love in the most
unexpected of places. SHREK reminds audiences that it is who you are and what you make of it that matters
most in our lives, not what you appear to be.
