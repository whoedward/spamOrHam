The SGC makes funding recommendations for B-Status Groups to Senate every Fall, Winter, and Spring.  On top of this, the Committee is responsible for planning campus-wide events such as the Fall and Winter Activities Fair.  Being on the committee is an excellent opportunity to make an impact on the entire Northwestern campus, and it looks great on your resume!
