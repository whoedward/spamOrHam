Mikayla,

We are pleased to offer you a position at Norris as a Technical Services Assistant. We hope you can join our team!

To accept this offer, please reply to this email, complete all relevant paperwork and have the paperwork signed by the full-time area supervisor, Michael McKean. Please turn these forms in to the Norris Student Employment Coordinator, Jenn Stripe, on the 3rd floor of Norris during business hours WITHIN 2 WORKING DAYS.

If you would like to accept this position but are not able to stop by within 2 days, please respond to this email and let us know. If you choose not to accept this position, please let us know that as well.

The necessary paperwork is available in the 3rd floor Administration office, or can be downloaded here under “New Employees”:

Please note that if you have held another position at Northwestern in the past, you only need to complete the Norris Employment Record, Personal Data Form and the Work-Study Authorization. You may also have to re-complete an I-9.

To comply with government regulations, the I-9 process MUST be complete prior to being hired. You must follow these steps:

1) Ensure you have ORIGINAL proof of identity documents as described here:

http://www.northwestern.edu/hr/managers-administrators/onboarding-procedures/E-verify/i9documents.pdf

You must have either one document from List A, or one each from Lists B & C. Faxes, copies, or emails cannot be accepted; if you do not have original documents, you must have them mailed to you or obtain new ones.

2) Complete the electronic I-9 as instructed in the New Employee Packet.

3) Bring your original documents to the Student Employment Coordinator on the 3rd floor of Norris. Documents will be returned to you immediately upon validation.
