Hi All,

We’re now a week away from the fall internship & job fair and want to thank you for helping us promote this event among the Northwestern community.

 

If you haven’t had a chance to pass along the following e-flyer to the NU groups & departments with whom you’re affiliated, please use the revised version (below) that  links to the student guide @ http://bit.ly/nucsfallfair (the guide lists all internships & jobs available with fall fair employers). The subject line “Meet 100+ top companies at the fall internship & job fair 10/1” can be used. You can simply copy and paste the image into a new email.

 

Please note that the fair is open to Northwestern undergraduate and graduate students as well as alumni. Students must dress in business attire, bring plenty of resumes and present their Wildcard.

 

Thank you, and we hope to see you there! Best,   Kelli
