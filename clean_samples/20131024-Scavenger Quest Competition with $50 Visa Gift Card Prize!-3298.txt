Hey everyone,

I've been feeling bored recently, so I think it's about time to host a dorm-wide game!
The scavenger quest will last from Sunday Oct. 27 to Sunday Nov. 3.
Test your wit against your fellow residents!
Struggle against my trickery!
Based on the clues I give you, you will need to find small pieces of paper hidden throughout ISRC. Form groups of up to 4 people to take part in this scavenger quest!
You must e-mail me whoever is in your group by Saturday 9pm.
The winning team will receive a $50 Visa Gift Card!
Remember to reply to this with the names of your teammates!
Thomas
