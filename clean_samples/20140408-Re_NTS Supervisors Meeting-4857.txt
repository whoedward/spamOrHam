I also cannot make this time - Mon/Wed/Fri are not very good for me, as I only have time between 2pm and 3pm. On Tues/Thurs I am available anytime besides 2-3:30pm

    I have class at this time, which is reflected on Shiftplanning. If we are leaning toward Wednesday, I am free anytime before 2 though.

            Please let me know if this time is still good for you.  Otherwise please suggest another time and day of the week- this will remain a bi-weekly meeting
