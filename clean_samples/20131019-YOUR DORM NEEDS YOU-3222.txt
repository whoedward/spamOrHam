Hi All!

During these past elections, we've seen just how amazing you all are. This dorm is once again in need of your enthusiasm! If you were to busy/timid/indifferent to have ran in the last election, this is your chance to get involved!

I am forming a Fellows' Committee and WE NEED YOU! If you want to get to know our awesome group of professors and get a say in the running of this dorm, then you should join! If you just want to network among our awesome professors to get a leg up, join also! (My committee is a no judgement zone). As a fellows chair, my job is to help you guys get to know our professors better, and to that end, we work with the professors and Kyle to throw socials, host firesides, and do anything else you think might make everybody know each other better!

Our first meeting will be this Sunday in the Main Lounge at 8PM. Be there otherwise, so square that you have corners.


ISRC-love,
Chang Tang
