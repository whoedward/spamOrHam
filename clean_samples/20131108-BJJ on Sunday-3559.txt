Hi everyone,

We will be having BJJ practice this Sunday as normal. 11am-1pm at Blomquist.

However, we will be starting a midweek practice this week on Wednesday nights for those who are interested in two practices and for those that can't make Sunday. After that I am planning on shortening practice on Sundays to 1 hour to encourage people to attend both, and to make time for a new Muay Thai class during the other hour.

Hope to see you all this Sunday!
Jacob
