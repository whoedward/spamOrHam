Hi all,

So, our Associate Master Erin Waxenbaum has been so awesome as to organize a TOUR of the FIELD MUSEUM on Wednesday, March 11th, at 1 PM. Dinner will be included- and you will be driven there, no CTA!! Expect to be back at around 6:30-7.

There are currently only 6 spots open- however, if there is more interest, there might be an opportunity to expand. You will also receive either a social or academic point for attending this event, according to whichever you need the most.

I'll be sending out the e-mail to sign up tomorrow night at 8PM. Keep your eyes peeled.

Paul
