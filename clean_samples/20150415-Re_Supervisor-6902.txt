Hey Ahren,

Thanks for letting us know.  Next week, can you come a bit early to the meeting?  Then you can give the supers a better idea of how many hours you can work and when.  Just remember our staff is stretched very thin right now, but we will do the best we can.

Best,
Christina

    Hi Chris,

    I've just realized how swamped I am with other responsibilities and decided I am satisfied as a non-supervisor.  I appreciate the offer to extend the deadline very much. 

    I should mention I will have to reduce my hours working for NTS as I'm making room for working the Graphic Design position I was just offered upstairs.  While I enjoy the company of the NTS crowd, ultimately the position does not help me grow creatively, and I'd like to refocus my attention toward a work study position that I think will. 

    I've cc'd the supervisors to let them know as well as tell them I won't be able to make the meeting tonight as I'll be downtown working at Catalyze.  I can still work my usual hours next week, but the next I'll likely have to cut back.

    I hope this doesn't cause inconvenience, and let me know if there's anything I can do to make the transition easier.

    Best,
    Ahren

        Hey Ahren,

        When you replied to the Availability survey back in March, you had indicated an interest in being a supervisor next year.  The application deadline closed Sunday, and I haven’t received an application from you.  If you’re still interested, I’d like to extend the deadline, and give you to the end of the day today to get me your materials.  The posting can be found on careercat.  Thanks!
