Hey!,

So the master key that CAs use to get into the trunk room and to unlock your room when you're in a towel is malfunctioning. Therefore please please please don't get locked out in a towel tonight or we will be forced to make you walk to Allison which would be pretty awkward. Also we cannot access the trunk room either.

Just a heads up!,
Hali
