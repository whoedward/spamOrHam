Hello, lovely ISRCers!

The coordinator for the Zombie Walk just got back to me, and he said make-up training for the Zombie Walk could be any time between 3:30 and 7 on Thursday. I know that kind of conflicts with Project Pumpkin, but I think I'm the only one so far who's signed up to for the latest shift (6-6:30). If you want to do zombie make-up on Friday, email me if 6-7 on Thursday at the EPL will work for you for training!
