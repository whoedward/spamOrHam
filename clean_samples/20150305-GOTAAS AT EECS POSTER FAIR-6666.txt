Hey MSAB!

Sorry for the short notice about this. We're hoping to be able to hand out flyers for the Gotaas award at the EECS poster fair tomorrow, starting at about noon. This will take less than an hour, but we need people to help hand out flyers to participants and someone to pick up the flyers from Ellen during the morning. Please let me or Brennan know if you can make it. We'd really appreciate the help. 

Thanks!
