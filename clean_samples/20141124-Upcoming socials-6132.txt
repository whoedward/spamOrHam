Hi all,

So, just to recap what's been said at previous Open Exec meetings:
There will be three socials during Reading Week.
The first will be Todoroki from Noon-roughly 1:30, though you can leave whenever, on Tuesday, December 2nd.
The second will be Whirlyball from 3:30-8:30PM, including transportation time, on Friday, December 5th.
The third will be ZooLights at 5:30PM on Saturday, December 6th.

For Todoroki, I want to shoot for around 24 people, but I can be a little flexible on this.
Whirlyball is like a cross between Lacrosse, basketball, and bumper cars. Here's the website: http://www.whirlyball.com/what/ Priority will be given to IM Football players. If you played two or more games with us this season then you will receive an e-mail a two hours earlier than the rest of ISRC. Space is limited to 14.
ZooLights is completely free so there won't be a limit on who can come. Please let me know if you would like to come. I will send an e-mail anyway, since we may or may not get hot cocoa or something of the like.

I will send out an e-mail for Todoroki spots on Wednesday, November 26th, at 8PM.
I will send out an e-mail for Whirlyball spots on Monday, December 1st, at 7PM for football players and at 9PM for the rest of ISRC.
I will send out an e-mail for ZooLights on Tuesday, December 2nd, at 8PM-again, you don't need to reply to secure a spot, but please reply anyway so I can just gauge who all is coming.

Thank you,
Paul Kim
