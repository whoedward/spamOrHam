Hi Evan,

This is just an overview of the conversation we had last night (2/25/2015) about meeting attendance.
As I said then, no disciplinary action will be taken at this time; rather, this is mostly for record-keeping purposes and to help you to stay on the right track.
With that in mind, please let me or any of the other supers or members of the pro staff know if you need any help.

Thank you for your cooperation,
