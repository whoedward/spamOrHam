Hello!

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving! The Game Room is happy to announce a used game and equipment sale.  Please view the linked Google Doc and reply with whichever games you would like to buy.  Once you've gotten a confirmation from me, you'll be able to pay and pick up the game from the Game Room on Friday, December 5th. Good luck with studying for finals!
