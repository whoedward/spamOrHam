Hey Guys,

Attached is a copy of the equipment check-in/check-out spreadsheet that I am working on. It is by no means finished (I have ambitions for this bad boy), but I'd love to hear what you guys think so far. Anything from color schemes to missing features to rearrangements. Positive comments and constructive criticisms are encouraged!

Thanks,
Ethan
