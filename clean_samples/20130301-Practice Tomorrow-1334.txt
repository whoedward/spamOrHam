Hi everyone,

Normal practice tomorrow 2-4pm in Blomquist. Hope to see you all there.

For the future, I'm hoping to change our practice times to Sunday mornings 11am-1pm, right before Muay Thai. If this would not work for you, please let me know. So far everyone I've talked to has been fine with it, but a bunch of people haven't been to practice the past couple of weeks so I don't know about you all.

-Jacob
