Hey guys,

Thank you to those who have already signed up for evaluations this week. For those of who who have yet to sign up, please do those ASAP and keep in mind that evaluations are required and have to be completed by Feb. 25. Failure to get this done in time could be grounds for termination so please don't let it come to that. Also, you'll get a raise so please sign up as soon as possible and we look forward to speaking with all of you.

Here's the link to the google doc where you can sign up:
