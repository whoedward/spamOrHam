    Subject: Extra Technician on October Second

     

    Hey All,

     

    The group in the Louis North room on Wednesday, the second of October would like to hire an extra technician. Equipment will be just a laptop and a microphone. It is worth noting that this will be considering an out of house event, so whoever takes can swipe in for off-site pay.

     

    Best,

    Ethan
