Hi all,

By now some of you should have nagging questions about topics covered in lectures or strategies to solve the integrals in the homework assignment/dailyQs. Please email me if you'd like me to cover something in particular in discussion tomorrow! Otherwise, I'll press forward and do a worked example of an integral in polar coordinates. We'll also discuss scheduling office hours and other course logistics.

The discussion will be held tomorrow in the same room/time slot as lecture.

Hope to see everyone there!

Karna
