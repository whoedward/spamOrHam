Hey guys,

That was my bad, when I was remaking the schedule on shiftplanning I missed Bobby's shift coverage today.

    Hey guys, that shift wasn't posted to shiftplanning until 11am even though the shift started at 10am. The rest of my shifts posted fine though, so I didn't suspect anything. Just a heads up that this may occur to other techs as well.

        Bobby took the shift from Will W., you are right.  He might've just forgotten.
