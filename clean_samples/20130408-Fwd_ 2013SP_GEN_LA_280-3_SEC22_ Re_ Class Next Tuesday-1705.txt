Hi All,

It seemed like a long time before our first meeting, so I wonder if you could take a look at a couple of very short articles before we meet on Tuesday. All three are on the order of 2-3 pages, so it shouldn't take long.

They are:

Matt Bai, Bloggers at the Gate, http://www.democracyjournal.org/12/6671.php?page=all

Greg Marx, Embrace the Wonk, http://www.cjr.org/feature/embrace_the_wonk_1.php?page=all

Chris Beam, The Only Political Science Article You'll Ever Have to Read, http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/low_concept/2010/06/the_only_politics_article_youll_ever_have_to_read.html

Also, as a short assignment, could you identify as many political science theories as you can in the Beam article. I will give a prize for the person who identifies the most.

Look forward to seeing you soon,
AR
