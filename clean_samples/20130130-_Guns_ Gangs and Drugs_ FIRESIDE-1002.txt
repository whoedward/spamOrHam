Our ISRC master, Prof. Alec Klein will be joining with us on this coming Tuesday (Feb. 5th) to discuss his work as the director of The Medill Justice Project (www.medilljusticeproject.org) which investigates potentially wrongful murder convictions. Over the past 14 years, undergraduate students with the project have played a role in the exoneration of several prisoners, some from death row. The work of students also helped informed the governorâ€™s decision to abolish the death penalty in Illinois. 

  

 So come to the Main Lounge at 7PM, and take advantage of this great opportunity. There will also be free pizzas and drinks !


See you then,

Arkar
