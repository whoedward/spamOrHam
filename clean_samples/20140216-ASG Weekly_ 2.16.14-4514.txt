The Service and Community Engagement Grant is an Associated Student Government grant up to $500.00 open to any Northwestern University student or group of students.

Student Group Apportionment Committee Applications due Feb. 19th

This application serves as the first step for your student group(s) to obtain a presence in Senate. Each application will be reviewed, interviews will take place and final decisions will be made prior to the first senate of the year.

In order to maximize representation in Senate, the Student Group Apportionment Committee highly encourages groups to apply for a seat together.  For your reference, groups with seats during the 2013-14 school year are listed on the last page.  From there, selected groups will decide independently how best to select a specific individual to represent those groups in Senate.

The deadline to submit applications is February 19th at 6:59pm.

Please submit your application and direct any questions to ASG Chief of Staff at asg-cos@u.northwestern.edu.  Interview times will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Applicantions can be found here. 

Student-Faculty Interaction Grants

Beginning this academic year, students and faculty members can apply for Student-Faculty Interaction Grants.  These grants provide funds that enable you to build meaningful experiences for your students. Grants will be available for undergraduates in a number of settings: your classes, seminars, advising groups, residences, and other places.

Read more about the Student-Faculty Interaction Grants here. 

Submit Feedback to Campus Voice

Campus Voice is ASG's campus-wide feedback platform that lets students submit ideas, report problems, and ask questions.
