Hey everyone,

A journalism student is doing a story on the club for a class. He took this picture, and embarrassingly, I don't know the full name of everyone in it. If you are in this picture, please send me your full name and who you are in the pic. 

Thanks,
Jacob "I guess I'm pretty bad at names" Kelter
