Hey everyone!

Gabe is RCB's social chair and was the lovely person who planned the RCB Formal. If you went, please out this survey so he can know what went great and what needs to be improved. 



Thanks!

> Thank you for attending RCB Formal earlier this November! I hope that you had a great time at the Field Museum for a night filled with dancing, foods and friends. To understand what went well and what could have been better, it'd be much appreciated if you could think back to your night and complete this short survey. Thanks!
