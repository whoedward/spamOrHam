Hello,

I'm leaving for the Baja race in Kansas tomorrow morning so I won't be able to make it to the meeting this week.  I don't remember if we got my Friday 8am-12pm covered at the last meeting, and I'll also need next Monday's 10am-2pm covered, since we won't be back until that evening. (Is Norris open for Memorial Day?)

Thanks,

Will
