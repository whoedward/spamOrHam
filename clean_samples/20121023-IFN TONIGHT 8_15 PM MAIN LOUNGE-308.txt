Hey ISRCers,

For IFN tonight, we are going to watch a Japanese anime called "Howl's Moving Castle" http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/howls_moving_castle/. It is directed by famous Japanese anime artist Hayao Miyazaki, and it was nominated for the Academy Award for the Best Animated Feature in 2005. Also, don't forget to come Academic and Fellow Committee meeting at 8PM. See you all there.

Thanks,
Arkar
