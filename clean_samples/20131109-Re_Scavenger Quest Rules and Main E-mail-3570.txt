        Since no one has found the 8th paper yet, I will be on the 2nd floor at 9:30 tonight to "help" (and I use the word help lightly) you guys find the paper.

            >>> I have hidden 10 papers along with 1 normal paper. These 10 papers are spread out throughout ISRC (3 in the main lounge, 2 in the basement, 2 on the 1st floor, 2 on the 2nd floor, and 1 on the third floor). NOTE: "Floors" include the stairwell portions that are vertically aligned with each floor. For these 10 papers, I will give NO hints. Each of these 10 papers have varied point allotment that change based on how difficult it should be to locate them without hints. So here is the point breakdown: B, D, T are worth 0.5 points each, C, E, M, S are worth 1 point each, and A, N, Z are worth 2 points each. You MUST e-mail me the letter you found and where you found the paper. I WILL NOT announce when a letter paper is found. So be alert!
