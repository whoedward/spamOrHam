Hey ISRC-ers!,

Sorry I didn't send this with Rohan's weekly announcements, but I have THREE amazing things you can do to celebrate halloween.

First, there's this awesome HAUNTED HOUSE in the basement of Seabury on WEDNESDAY that I'd love to take you guys to. It's FREE but donations are recommended. It's from 7-10 with treats after you go through the haunted house. I mean SCARY AND FOOD RELATED. what else do you want?? We'll meet in the lobby at 7 to walk over so we can get treats fast!

Second, there's a concert of haunting and scary music on WEDNESDAY in Alice Millar Chapel, literally across the street from us. This is also FREE and a great way to start of the Halloween day since it starts at 11:55 pm!! I'll defs (definitely) be going and if you want, you can join me!

Last, CHIPOTLE HAS $3 BOORITOS IF YOU SHOW UP IN COSTUME. OH MY GOODNESS. BOORITOS. I LOVE IT. 
My residential hall did this last year and it was amazing. The line gets long though, so we'll have to leave pretty early if we want to eat at a decent hour, so like 5 ish. 

Sorry for emailing you guys with ALL THE AMAZING THINGS that you can do. And sorry for the caps lock.

Your CA that loves halloween and food!,
Hali
