Dear all,

My class schedule got moved around a lot and now I'm unable to make two of my shifts. 

Tuesday 2 - 4 continuing ed
Wednesday 7 - 12 (technically I can make it from 9 - 12, but if you want the whole shift you can take it)

Ideally I would like to get rid of these permanently so if you want to trade hours that would be perfect but that can wait until the meeting. I'll take any temporary coverage!

All the best,
Juan Herrera
