    Hey ISRC!

    We are having the first munchies of the year on Wednesday night. I'm trying to use ALLCAPS and stuff to get your attention, so you guys should probably come. We are getting gyros and falafel from Greek Fire Grill. And if that's not enough, David Harris is coming from ASG to explain what that is. If you're too lazy to google three letters come instead to find out.

    See you there,
    Jonas
