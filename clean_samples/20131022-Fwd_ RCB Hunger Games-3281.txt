Hi everyone!

The Residential College Board (RCB) is sponsoring a "Hunger Games" competition! I believe some of your fellow residents took part last year. For those not participating, you can watch the action unfold LIVE on one of the big screens in Tech. Don't miss out on this event. And may the odds be ever in your favor!

Have a great Wednesday!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan



WANT TO SHOW YOUR WORTH?
Volunteer as tribute in
the 2nd Annual 
RCB HUNGER GAMES 
on November 2 at NOON.
(That's 2.5 hours before the FB game.)

If you've read this far, you get a hint:
The arena will be TECH!

PRIZES: Movie Gift Card and more!
Sign-up by emailing jennhuang@u.northwestern.edu today! *
*A reaping may occur in your RC District if there are enough volunteers!

May the odds be ever in your favor.
