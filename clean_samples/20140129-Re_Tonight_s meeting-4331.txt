    Hi,

    I haven't seen an email yet about tonight's meeting, but I've got to be in the Ford shop to work on a team project and then I have Baja at 7 so I won't be able to make it tonight. 

    Could I get my Friday 12-2pm covered so I can attend an info session? Someone could also take the 10am-12 if they want to make it more worth their time. 

    Thanks,

    Will
