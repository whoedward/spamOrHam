Hi All,

I'll be sending out an email at 9p tonight about signing up for the Northlight Theater and Chicago Architecture River Cruise, so look out for the signups for these following events tonight!:

Shining Lives, a musical, at Northlight Theater: It's 1922 and the young women of Chicago's Radium Dial Company are living a dream - earning good wages and beaming with new-found independence. After years of hand painting watch dials, the so-called "harmless" radium leads to devastating results. Four courageous women upend their lives with a determination to change the future in this compelling new musical, the transcendent tale of heroic lives that glowed with promise.   Book & lyrics by Jessica Thebus, Music by Andre Pluess & Amanda Dehnert; directed by Jessica Thebus.

    Event date: Saturday, May 9th (campus departure 6:45p/campus return 10:15p)
    Ticket price: $5

Chicago Architecture River Cruise: Experience one of the worldâ€™s most beautiful cities on a 90-minute cruise on the historic Chicago River. On this architecture cruise, head down the main branch of the Chicago River, up the north branch to the East Bank Club, and then south past Willis Tower (Sears Tower) to the old Post Office Building. Take in magnificent city skyline views as you see more than 40 notable buildings, including the John Hancock Center and the Wrigley Building, and learn about their distinctive architecture from your onboard guide, an expert in architecture.

    Event date: Saturday, May 16th (campus departure 12:15p/campus return 4:15p)
    Ticket price: $10

Thanks!
