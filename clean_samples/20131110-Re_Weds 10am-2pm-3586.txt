    Hey guys,

    This is for Weds 10am-2pm. I want to attend my friend's thesis defense and I also have to pick up my friend from the airport at 2pm. I was hoping someone (or people) could cover these shifts for me. I'm even down for people to cover 10-11am and 1-2pm and I can still work 11-1pm, but I rather just have the whole two shifts to be covered. Thanks!

    Best,
