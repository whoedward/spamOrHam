Hi Brett,

Alex Yang was telling me that you are considering returning to NTS this year. I'm super excited to hear this, and wanted to follow up on that. If you are still thinking about coming back to us, you can find the relevant application on CareerCat.

If not, best of luck to you!

Either way, it will be good to hear from you again!

Best,
