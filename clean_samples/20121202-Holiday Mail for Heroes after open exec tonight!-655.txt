Hey everyone,
 
Tonight after open exec, we will have the last ISRC-organized philanthropy event of the quarter, a Holiday Mail for Heroes event.  We will be making holiday cards for veterans and active-duty service members.
 
This is an RCB-wide event; each of the Res Colleges is being asked to make holiday cards for military members, and they will all be collected and sent off together.
 
Here is a link to information about the program, if you are interested:  http://www.redcross.org/support/get-involved/holiday-mail-for-heroes
 
I hope to see you there!  Just stick around in the main lounge whenever open exec ends.  I will bring construction paper and markers.
 
This is a great way to give back to the brave people who make it possible for us to have safe and happy holidays here at home, so please show up!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
