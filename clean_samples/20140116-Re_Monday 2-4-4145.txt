Hey Aliyah,

I don't know what really happened.. but if you can't cover this shift, just release it on shiftplanning and also e-mail the listserv for a permanent shift request.

    I got shiftplanning notifications saying that I had been put on the monday 2-4 shift. Was that supposed to happen? I really need to go to office hours and that is the only time during the week that I can go.
