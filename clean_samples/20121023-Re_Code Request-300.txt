Professor,

I cannot see my score, although the mean and median are there. What would you like me to do?

        Hello Professor,

        Hopefully this issue has been resolved, as I have my midterm with me right now. If you need the copy back, I can bring it to your office.

        Thanks,
        Ethan

            Hi Ethan,

            For some reason, I don't see your midterm grade. TAs says that they don't see your exam.
            However, I remember I saw you on the exam.

            Is there something that I miss here?

                Hello Professor,

                On Friday, there was an issue with the divide and conquer code, and you asked me to send you the .m file. However, after examining my code, I discovered the issue. To summarize, I used "ceil()" instead of "floor() +1," which does not work, of course. Thanks for you very much anyway. Take care.

                Thank you,
                Ethan Robison
