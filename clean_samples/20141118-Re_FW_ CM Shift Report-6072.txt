Michael,

I was on that shift with Bobby, and he let me know about the microphone. I was on my way to pick it up, but he was able to figure out that it belonged in Northwestern. The microphone was not labeled.

Someone was probably cleaning up and forgot to check the mic on the lectern. We'll remind people during the staff meeting that smart room microphones stay in the smart room.

For the future, Tech should note that they are responsible for checking all a/v equipment when breaking down a room and Housestaff should note that they are not storing any equipment that does not belong to their department. Most of the stuff we have around here is pretty pricey.

I went down to observe the situation but he did not approach anybody at the time and left the building. In the event that he does return and tries to solicit anything, the CM on shift should inform him of our vendor policies and direct him to administration office.
