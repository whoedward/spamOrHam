Hey guys Phoebe took my 12-4,
can someone please take my 4-6?
Just saying, I've taken many various shifts for various people...

    Hey guys, 
    Because of the home football game, the club meeting I have is moved from 12-6 on Sunday, rather than Saturday. 
    Therefore, I need it covered.
    Anyone? 
    I've also released it on ShiftPlanning, but my 12-2 isn't even in ShiftPlanning for some reason.

    Thanks,
    Will Hyun
