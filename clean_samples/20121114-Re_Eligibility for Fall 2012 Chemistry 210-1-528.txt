Dr. Priest,

I contacted my father about the issue, and he has informed me that he contacted the organization and had them express send my transcript. Hopefully the document arrives soon, and this issue can be resolved.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    Ethan,
    you really need to get this taken care of immediately. You will not receive a grade for organic chemistry unless it is resolved.

If, at that time, the credit does not appear on your transcript, pressure will be put upon you to have that credit appear. If it the credit cannot ultimately be demonstrated, then you may not receive a grade in the course. I am sure it will all work out, but we like to warn students as early in the process as possible.

It should be noted that I have the (unoffical) transcripts to indicate as such, that my school has my scores on record, and that I had my scores sent in by Collegeboard. At least, they claim to have sent them, if I am not mistaken. In terms of specific action, please respond and inform me as to what I should do.

It may be the case that you have received a qualifying AP/IB exam score, but that this score and the associated credit for Chemistry 103 has not yet appeared on your Northwestern transcript. It may also be the case that the relevant transfer credit is not yet appearing on your transcript.

There may be financial consequences to missing the deadline. You will not be able to add another course, such as Chemistry 101 or 171, after this deadline.
