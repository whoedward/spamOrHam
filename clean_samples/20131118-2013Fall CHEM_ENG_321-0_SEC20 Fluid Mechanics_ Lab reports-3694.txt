Dear Class,

You should have received your graded lab report for Lab #4 in class today.  I am currently grading your last lab report, and will return them to you once I'm done.  Since I no longer have any regularly scheduled office hours, please contact me via email if you have any questions about your grade and we can arrange a time to chat.  Your grades should also be visible to you on Blackboard.

Thanks,

Erica
