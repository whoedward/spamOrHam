For those of you signed up for the meeting tomorrow (which is a lot of you), don't forget to meet in WIldcat Room B at 5:30pm, and don't forget to clock in on your way over! 

If you still haven't signed up for a session, or can no longer make tomorrow's session, don't fret, I'll have one more session scheduled after Thanksgiving break.

Love and Linens,
Meredith

    Hey New Norris Employees, 

    It's Meredith, your friendly neighborhood SSDM! Welcome to the Norris family! I hope you've all started to get settled into your new positions at Norris and are LOVING IT as you darn well should.

    You should have all been trained within your individual department, but now it's time for you all to learn where you fit within Norris as a community. I will be hosting three orientation sessions in the upcoming weeks, where I'll be sharing with you the goals of Norris, telling you a little bit about how everything in Norris runs, and showing you around the building to get you acquainted, and to get you all acquainted with each other. I've got three options listed below, and attendance at one of the meetings is mandatory. 

    Friday, 11/9 2PM, Rock Room
    Wednesday, 11/14 10AM, Wildcat Room A
    Monday, 11/19 5:30PM, Wildcat Room B

    Fill out this spreadsheet with your name, and mark the meeting you'll be attending. If you can't make any of these times, let me know and I'll see what I can do about planning another session.  Plan on being in Norris for about an hour.


    See you soon!

    Norris love,

    Meredith
