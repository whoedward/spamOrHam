Hey everyone, 

Here is the updated points list: http://bit.ly/UEzfy4

At this point in the quarter, there are no more opportunities to earn points (except academic/social). 

The only thing I have yet factored in: the most recent IFN. Also, I received only a partial attendance list from the fellows social, so please e-mail me if you went. 

However, most of you are missing one point in either exec/committee or service categories.

If you want to live here next year, and you are not currently on 3rd list, please e-mail me immediately. By University policy, you are not eligible to live here next year. This is your last chance to get onto 3rd list this quarter. 

Also, if you would like to appeal for points, please e-mail me. If it can't be resolved by e-mail, we can meet in person. 

The housing process will begin at the start of spring quarter, so look out for an e-mail from me then. 

Thanks!

Hannah
