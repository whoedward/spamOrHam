Hello Professor,

Please excuse the tardiness with which I am replying (blame the fact that I sleep all day and work all night, perhaps).
Attached is a picture (no scanners are here) of the poster draft. I will also attempt to put something on safe assign. Please note that you should be able to zoom into the picture, but this might make it a little too large. Don't worry, I'm bringing the hard copy to class.

Many thanks,
Ethan

    Dear Wonderful Ethan,
    Of course you are always sorely missed when you are not in class.  For the poster, you can either drop:

        drop a sketch of it off at my office in Kresge--Kresge 2-265. If I'm not there,  you'll find a plastic bin on my office door that you can put it in.
        scan it and attach it to an email

    As for the graphics, I'm certain Dean Holtgreive will get back to you, but his answer is likely to be just drop it off at his office in Tech.  

    Hope all is well, Ethan,

    Professor Herrick

        Hello, Wonderful Professors!

        A small fact to which you might be privy: I was absent from class this morning. I do indeed have a draft of my poster as well as the missing second segment of the graphics homework. However, both exist in the real world (that is to say non-digitally). If you would like me to scan them and email them to you, I certainly can and will. Otherwise, please let me know how it is that I should ameliorate this rather significant problem.

        Thank you very much,
        Ethan Robison
