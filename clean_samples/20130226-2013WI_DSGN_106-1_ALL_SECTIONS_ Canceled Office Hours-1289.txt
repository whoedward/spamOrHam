Hello All,
Due to the snow, office hours will be canceled today. As always, I'm very happy to answer questions via email at samuelschwartz2012@u.northwestern.edu, or by cell (847)902-9551. I'll be adding an extra hour to this weeks Wednesday hours: which will be from 2-4pm.

If your team has any other questions, concerns, uncertainties, or just wants to run your plans by someone, I'm happy to set up an appointment.

Thanks, have a good week!
-Sam
