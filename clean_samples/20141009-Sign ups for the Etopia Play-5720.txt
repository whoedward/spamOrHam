Hello!

Sorry I forgot to send this out earlier. Please reply to me by 4 PM tomorrow evening if you want to go. I will send the list of your names to Professor Grayson who is holding reservations for ISRC.

Here's the information about the play:

There's a play produced by an EECS professor, Matthew Grayson, about a troubled female drone pilot. It's called "Grounded." He's holding 20 seats for ISRC residents to go on Sunday at 2 pm. I need to give him a list of people coming by tomorrow evening. This is FREE!

Here's his description of the play: 
This year the ETOPiA play is "Grounded" about a troubled female drone pilot. The play touches upon themes of international importance, as drones now constitute the majority of our military air power, and as drone strikes play an important role in the US policy of international pre-emptive strikes. Run time = 70 min., optional post-performance discussion = 15 min.
