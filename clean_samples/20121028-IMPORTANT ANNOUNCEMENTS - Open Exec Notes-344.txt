Hi everyone, 

I have attached the notes from tonight's open exec meeting. 

Important Announcement
Our secretary, Darlene, has resigned. If you are interested in running for the position of secretary on the ISRC Exec Board...

1) Read the attached secretary role description. The weekly time commitment is 2-4 hours. Length of term is until the end of winter quarter. 
2) Make sure you are available on Mondays, at 7pm for our weekly closed exec board meeting. (Meeting times change every quarter) 
3) Find Hannah in room 309 for a petition of eligibility. Complete the form, with 15 signatures from ISRC residents, and give it to Hannah (or put it under the door) by 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 31. 

Being on the ISRC Exec Board is definitely a commitment, but you play a very big role in what goes on in the dorm. Plus, you get to spend time with some pretty awesome people (like our master staff!). If you have any questions, talk to any member currently on Exec. 

For all residents: The secretary election will be next Sunday at 8pm in the main lounge. Attendance is MANDATORY. There will be food. Please be there. E-mail Hannah with questions/concerns. 

Thanks everybody! Have a great week! 

Hannah
