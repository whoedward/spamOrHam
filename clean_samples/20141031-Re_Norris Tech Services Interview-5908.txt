    I can do 1:30 today if the option is still available.  That would be perfect.

        Hi Ahren,

        If you're free today at 1:30 p.m., that works for everyone. If not, how about next Wednesday (11/5) at 1:30 p.m.?
        Both would be in Norris. Just come to the center desk and let them know that you are here for a Tech Services interview.

        Best,
