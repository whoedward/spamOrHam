    Hello and hello, NTS.  

    I know you're all busy procrastinating in preparation for finals week--I as well.  However, I have the (blessing? curse?)...OPPORTUNITY to finish and submit all of my final work by Monday afternoon.  Would anyone be interested in snatching up a few extra hours on Wednesday so I could go home early?  It's not that big of a deal, but if you're interested, write me up.

    Sidetracked Salutations,

    Marina
