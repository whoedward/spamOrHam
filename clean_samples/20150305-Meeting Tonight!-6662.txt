Hey all!

This is a reminder that we're meeting tonight at 6pm in the Dean's Conference Room as usual. Please try to fill out project forms and complete any previous action items for your projects, let us know if you can't make it to the meeting, and keep thinking of ideas for E-Week t-shirts.

Thanks!
