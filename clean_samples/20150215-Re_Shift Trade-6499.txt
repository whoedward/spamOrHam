    Hi all,

    Would anyone be willing to take my Wednesday 10AM-12PM shift?  I'm sorry about the super last minute trade, but I got a sudden request from my professor to meet with him at that time today. I don't think any other time would work for him.

    I'd really appreciate it if someone could take it, but if not, then that's okay!

    Thank you,
