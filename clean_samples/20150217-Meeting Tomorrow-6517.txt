Hi guys,

I'm sorry to say, but I won't be able to attend the meeting tomorrow. I'm supporting NUDivest and the ASG Senate voting meeting will be tomorrow during that time. 

I also need my Tuesday (2/24) 4-8 shifts covered. There's a Campus Inclusion and Community meeting during both shifts I'm required to attend. If that's all, please let me know if you guys need anything else!

Thanks!
Magan
