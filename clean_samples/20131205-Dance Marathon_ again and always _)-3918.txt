Hello, lovely ISRCers,

Here's how to register late for Dance Marathon: email finance@nudm.org and just informally let them know of your interest. You have to pay $60, but that's only $10 more than the regular registration fee. Do it ASAP so you can start fundraising!!!!!

Also, the DM Holiday Party is this Saturday from 12-2 in the Northwestern Room in Norris. It's an opportunity for dancers and fundraisers to meet members of Team Joseph and other families affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I will be leading a group over at 1 from the main lounge. Even if you're not dancing, you can come if you're involved in fundraising, considering late registration, or simply need a philanthropy point. Yes, you read that correctly - this is the last opportunity for a philanthropy point! You also don't have to go at 1 - you can stop by any time for as long or short a time as you'd like. 

Feel free to email me with questions! Thanks, guys, and good luck with finals!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
