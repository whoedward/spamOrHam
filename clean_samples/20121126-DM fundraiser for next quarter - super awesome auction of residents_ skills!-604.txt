Hey everyone!
 
This is still a ways off, but I wanted to let you know about it now so you can start thinking about it.
 
Next quarter, we are going to have our biggest Dance Marathon fundraiser of the year.  We are going to auction off residents who volunteer their skills or services.  All the money raised will go towards ISRC's DM team.
 
This is where you come in.  Do you have a special talent that you'd like to auction off?  Then please, sign up for the auction!  For example, if you're artistic, you could volunteer to design a T-shirt or logo for the highest bidder's group.  If you're musical, you could auction off a music lesson.  If you're great at cooking, you could volunteer to cook dinner for the highest bidder.
 
It doesn't even have to be something that requires a special talent.  You could volunteer to do the highest bidder's laundry for two weeks, or dye your hair a crazy color if a certain amount of money is bid.
 
Basically, there's no limit to what you can do!
 
As I said, this will happen sometime during winter quarter, but I wanted to let you guys know about it now so you can start thinking about what you might want to auction off.  I know we have a lot of talent and creativity in ISRC, and I'm sure you will come up with amazing ideas!
 
If you would like to volunteer for this, e-mail me and tell me what you would like to auction off!
 
Let me know if you have any questions!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
