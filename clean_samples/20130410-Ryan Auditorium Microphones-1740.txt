Hello Michael,

I am currently working the Ryan event for KASA.
The members of KASA are currently rehearsing for an event in Ryan auditorium on May 3rd . For an unknown reason, the microphone volume is capped at a volume level lower than the maximum. The system volume does not have this problem.

Could you please look into this issue?

Thanks for your help,
Ethan Robison
