    Hi there!

    I was wondering if anyone would be free to take a partial shift coverage for me?  The coverage would be for either Monday: 7-8 pm and/or Tuesday 7-8.  I've got a crazy extracurricular schedule this week so it would be awesome if someone could help out!

                                                                      Vicky
