Hey All,

This is an announcement concerning our fancy new projectors in Arch, Evans, and Alumni. The projectors are HDMI compatible (but can still handle VGA) and are super slick.
Note that these projectors use a different kind of remote than the non-HD projectors. Instead of the grayish/black, squat remotes, they use a shinier black, sleek remote. There will be one of each kind in your "Ask me About A/V" bags. The screens that they use are motorized, and each one has a remote velcroed to the wall nearby.
That just about covers it. If you have any questions about them, email Michael or any of the supers and we'll do out best to help you out!

Best,
Ethan
