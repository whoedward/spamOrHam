Hi everyone!

For those of you who weren't at the first open exec of the quarter, I'm happy to announce International Dinner, ISRC's winter formal event!
International Dinner, or ID, is a banquet that ISRC hosts every year at the John Evans Alumni Center (behind Jones).
To attend ID, you must, solo or with another resident, prepare some sort of international cuisine and bring it to the event.

The best part?
You won't pay a penny for you ingredients or supplies. You also don't have to buy anything. Exec will take care of purchasing everything, as long as you provide us with a recipe and list of ingredients.

This year ID will take place on Sunday, February 23rd, 6-9pm.
We are requesting that recipes are in by Sunday, Jan. 26th, at 9:30pm.

Please let me know if you have ANY questions.

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
