Hi all,
We have byes for both football and volleyball tomorrow!
I do believe Dominique wanted to practice at Deering at noon tomorrow; if you would also like to practice, please meet me in the main lounge at 11:50AM and we'll head over together. This is completely optional, I know you guys are busy.

Volleyball will not be holding practice.

We forfeited dodgeball last Tuesday because not enough people showed up! Please come, especially if you are a woman, because we need to have at least 3 women to play (I believe we had 0 last time).

Thanks
Paul
