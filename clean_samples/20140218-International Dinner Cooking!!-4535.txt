Hi everyone!

For those of you that have given me your recipes, International Dinner is this Sunday at 6pm!!

On Friday evening, we will start cook times for the event. These will continue up until the event starts, although getting your dish prepared earlier is always better. Please fill out the attached form ASAP in order to get a slot to cook your dish. You will head to the ISRC Library (off the main lounge) when it is your time to cook in order to pick up your ingredients and cookware.

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
