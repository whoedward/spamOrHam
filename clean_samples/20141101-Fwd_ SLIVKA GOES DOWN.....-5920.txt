Well hello there!!!

I hope everyone is having a great and safe Halloween weekend! This is just a reminder that this Sunday, is the burial of Slivka at 12:00 pm at Long Field. Please wear Black or dark colors to pay your respect and bring your Wildcards. As a group we will be leaving from Chapin at 11:30 am. Please meet in the lobby promptly at this time, as we cannot be late, that would be rude to Slivka's friends and family. We cannot be selfish at this time.

If anyone wants a preview of this week's service please look below:
