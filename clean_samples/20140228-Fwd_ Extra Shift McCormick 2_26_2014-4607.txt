I'm sorry - I didn't realize that Juan or Will felt at all put-upon.  After I finished shutting down the system and resetting the light and sound boards, I asked them if they'd mind getting the microphones and mic stands (they were both in the booth with me) since I wanted to catch the shuttle.  I didn't really get any impression of resentment or anything, but I was in a hurry so that might have affected my level of attention.
I do wish they'd made it more clear that they wanted my help with the mics, but part of that's on me for not picking up on it.  I'll make sure to be more explicit in communicating.

-Ryan

    Hey Ryan,

    Will was just talking to us about the extra tech shift last night. As far as I can tell, you finished the event and then left without cleaning up. Please note that being on an extra tech shift means that you are responsible for the equipment from the time you get on shift until, if you are on the tail end shift, it is back in the lab. Now, when you are shift, please feel free to call the other techs currently in Norris to help you with clean-up, but understand that it is not acceptable to simply leave clean-up to the other techs without any help on your part. Please be more considerate next time. Consider this your warning for the quarter.

    If you have any questions about this or anything else, please email me or NTSsupervisors@gmail.com with your issue.
