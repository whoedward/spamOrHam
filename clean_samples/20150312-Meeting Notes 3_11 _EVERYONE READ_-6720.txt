Evening everyone!

Because there was a lot of information at the meeting and some were absent for various academic reasons, here are the notes from last night.  Shiftplanning has been updated through spring break, so please log in and make sure your schedule is correct.

Meeting Notes

    Norris closes Friday 3/20 at 6PM and opens on Sunday, 3/28 at 10AM.
    Fill out your spring schedules for Will by 3/18, 11:59PM.  If you do not, you will not be assigned any shifts for spring quarter.  The spring schedule should be ready on 3/21.
    Don't forget to do your cleaning tasks on shift & fill out shift logs.  "Checking projector" means going to the menu and writing down the lamp hours.  If you're checking mics, replace the batteries if they're at one bar.
    Notes from Chris: 

        We have added wall controls in Scholars, so a remote control will no longer be needed.  Please tell everyone to take a look, and let me know if you have any questions.

        The back room in the Lab has been cleaned out.  It will be “closed” for cleaning/reorganization for the next week.

        I will be hiring 2 new supers to join your team.  This is in response to your suggestions to have an overlap.  I’ll send out an email when the positions have been posted to career cat.
        As techs are beginning to run out of hours, I will be hiring a few techs to join our team.  Please tell everyone to pass that on to friends looking for on campus jobs.
