IT'S HERE IT'S HERE!

Check out the attached flyer for details on time and what will be going on.  We'll be giving out points to your departments for attendance (who's trying to win that prize? EVERYONE.) as well as for the winner of the ugly sweater contest.  Get ready, Norris, this is gonna be a good one. Tis the Season!

Click on the flyer. It's worth your while, I promise. 

Forever Yours,
Meredith
