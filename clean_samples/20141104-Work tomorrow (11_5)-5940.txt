Hello supervisors,

As you know I was sick for training this past Sunday. I became increasingly sick, which included a trip to the emergency room yesterday. I have been resting a lot, and I believe I am starting to get better. However, I am still suffering from a headache and dizziness, so I think it would be best if I did not come in for work tomorrow morning. I released the shift on shiftplanning but I recognize it's highly unlikely that anyone would pick it up. Am I able to miss the shift for health reasons?

If I have gotten somewhat better by tomorrow as I expect, I will work my shift from 8pm-12am, though I would prefer not to be at the meeting, in order that I may get additional rest. 

Thanks,

Evan
