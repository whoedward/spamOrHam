Hey guys! 


So February is Black History Month and on Monday we just had a holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. and this event will be a great way to celebrate the mix of cultures on campus! 


It has free food, a chill atmosphere, and tons of fun! So come join me tonight for a short walk over to Norris for this awesome event at 5:50!
