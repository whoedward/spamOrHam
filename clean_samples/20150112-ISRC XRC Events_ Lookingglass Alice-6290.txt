Lookingglass Alice, Lookingglass Theater: Imagination soars and laughter and awe abound when this signature production returns with all its gravity-defying spectacle and breathtaking theatricality. Lookingglass Alice is a marvel for all ages, transporting audiences down the rabbit hole to a circus-infused playground for an exhilarating wonderland adventure inspired by Lewis Carrollâ€™s beloved stories.  Adapted and directed by David Catlin from the works of Lewis Carroll; produced in association with The Actors Gymnasium. http://lookingglasstheatre.org/event_page/lookingglass-alice/

Jen
