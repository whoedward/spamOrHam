Greetings my assassins,

The time for clandestine activity is drawing nearer! Here are the rules for this game of assassins. Read carefully, for I WILL NOT give you your target unless you answer the questions that are in the rules. I will tell everyone who has answered the questions properly their targets on Saturday.

Let the coalitions/betrayals/chaos begin! (Soon...)

Thomas
