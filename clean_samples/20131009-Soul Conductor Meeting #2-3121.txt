Hello team!

Tomorrow at 10:30 we will be gathering in the Theatre Interpretations Center east conference room; my number is (646) 808-6511 call me if you think you'll have trouble finding it! When you walk in the main (torso) lobby walk up the stairs, the conference room area is down the hallway just beyond the offices. 

Come with a concrete broken down list of things you foresee needing for the show, and some illustration of your vision (photos from google/power point etc.). At our next meeting on the 17th your design presentations should be close to final for our two week pre production meeting with vertigo on Monday the 21st at 10:45. We'll talk more about that tomorrow.
