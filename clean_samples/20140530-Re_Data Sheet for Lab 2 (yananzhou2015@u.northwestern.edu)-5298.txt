    Great. I can do 3 and 4 and upload them by Saturday evening. 
    Do you guys have time during weekend to discuss about the project? I can do Saturday morning/early afternoon (maybe evening) and Sunday after 4

    June

>>>                                         The difference between the analyses carried out in questions 1-3 and 4-6, is a fundamental one. Questions 1-3 investigate the deviations of the two testers based on the average values calculated from their individual rock measurements. This way of finding the fundamental deviation of the two testers is flawed, as it does not nullify any of the nuisance factors that could occur. The second method on the other hand does take steps to rid the analysis of the largest nuisance factor: differing rock sizes. By comparing the testers based on their measurements of each individual rock, this removes any assumptions about the similarity of the rock sizes, and allows for smaller standard deviation.
>>>
>>>                                         It seems that these claims are backed up by the results of the previous analysis. Based on the averages the interval was (-.5608, .2068). This is compared to an interval of (-.00717, 360366) for the paired analysis. There are a few important things to point out: size of intervals, shift of intervals, and difference in conclusions from intervals. The paired interval is much smaller (about half that of the other). This difference is inspite of the fact that the first interval was based on a Z test, and the paired was calculated based on a t test. This shows that the paired test is the more precise of the two tests. Another thing is that the first test showed the interval skewed negative, whereas the paired test shows almost completely a positive interval. This is due to the sensitivity of each method to outliers, where an individual test could have had a large effect on the averages calculated, and a much smaller effect on the paired test. This causes the third observation: that the conclusions derived from each test are very different. With the first interval it seems that there was no large fundamental deviation between the testers. The paired test however, shows with a large certainty that there was indeed a consisted deviation between the testers.
>>>
>>>                                         It is far better to use the pair analysis in order to compare the two people measuring. It takes away more of the nuisance factors, and is far less affected by any outliers that may randomly occur in experimentation. For these reasons, it is far more appropriate to use the paired test in this case.
