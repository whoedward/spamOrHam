Anyone interested?
11:30 PM tonight - i probably would leave around 10ish, doors open at 11, first come first seat - so, no guaranteed seating.
Neo-Futurists seems like a really really cool group, TMLMTBGB seems like an awesome show. the concept is trying to do 30 plays in 60 minutes, lots of audience participation- based on the Neo-Futurist movement based off of the similar Italian movement believe it or not

Cost of admission is $9 plus however much you roll on a die - so anywhere from 10-15 dollars.
We can take Uber there, for free plus tips - if you're interested in going e-mail me and i'll let you know more on that. beats the CTA by far.

Me Mike and Mahalia are going!! if you're busy or don't want to or previous plans etc that's completely cool. also if i forgot anyone that might want to go let them know please?
the theater is in Andersonville, so maybe a 20 min drive.

ok thanks everyone
