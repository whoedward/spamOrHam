Class,

I posted the test we took today and its solution in "Documents/Another practice test and solution". Please keep in mind that this was never given as a test before, they're just some problems I cobbled together. I hope that they're somewhat representative of half a test you could actually receive, though.

I'm happy to accomodate office hour requests this weekend/Monday for anyone who wants to go over some concepts/homework/previous dailyQs/tests. Just contact me to set up a time to meet.

Study hard! I'll see you all next Tuesday.

Sincerely,

Karna
