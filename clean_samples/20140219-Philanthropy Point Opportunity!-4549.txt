Hello, lovely ISRCers!

For anyone not dancing in DM, there is the tradition of a Kids Fair on Saturday March 8th, during the actual dancing. Kids will be in Norris from 11am-1:30pm, and different groups get to host booths (kind of like Project Pumpkin). Before I can sign ISRC up for a booth, I need to know if enough of you are willing to sign up for half-hour shifts so that all the slots between 10:30 and 1:30 will be filled. Each half-hour shift will get you half a philanthropy point. I will most likely be dancing, so I can't help too much with the actual event, just with the planning.


Please email me ASAP if you think you'll be interested in volunteering, and for which time slot!


ISRC-love,

Ayla
