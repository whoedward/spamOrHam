        It looks like no one's using the stage 5:30-6, so we can actually get a full hour practice from 5:30-6:30. But KASA show organizers will only be there starting at 6.

        So 5:30 on Thursday!!!

            Also, probably no need to bring props to the Thursday rehearsal, but BRING EVERYTHING TOMORROW (Wednesday).

                Hey guys,

                So apparently the dress rehearsal for tomorrow got cancelled and is rescheduled for 6 P.M. on Thursday. Furthermore, we will only have 30 minutes instead of an hour.

                If you guys could make this time, I would really really appreciate it. Please let us know if you can.

                Friday's rehearsal remains the same.

                Lastly, for tomorrow, Master Kallo will come in at 9 P.M. to review our show. Before then, I plan on us going through everything once. One thing we really need to work on, is coordinating the breaks, so make sure you know who you're holding for as well as when you are breaking.

                I expect to see everyone.

                Thanks,
                Davin
