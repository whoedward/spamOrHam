Hi ISRC,

If you are living in a res college or res hall next year, this is important information, please read:
If you want to live in ISRC next year:

    Make sure you are at least on 3rd list. If not, talk to me, we can work something out.
    Sign the Housing Contract with the university here: https://rms.resservices.northwestern.edu 
    Print out the Letter of Intent attached to this email, fill it out and give it to me by April 8
    Choose your top 3 rooms and give those to me by April 15

If you want to live in another Res College next year:

    Make sure you are at least on 3rd list. If not, talk to me, we can work something out.
    Sign the Housing Contract with the university here: https://rms.resservices.northwestern.edu 
    Contact me ASAP so we can talk to the VP of that res college and ensure you get through their housing procedure-- you will still need to do the Letter of Intent, but it will be turned in to that res college

If you want to live in Res Hall next year:

    Sign the Housing Contract: https://rms.resservices.northwestern.edu 
    You'll get an email with priority numbers-- this will be how you pick a room next year
    Follow further instructions you receive on that. Information on res hall housing is available here: http://www.northwestern.edu/living/housing-assignments/returning-students/overview/index.html
