        Hey everyone,

        Sorry for the short-notice, but would it be possible for anyone to cover the 10-midnight shift tonight?  I woke up today a lot more sick than I'd been yesterday, and I'm really trying to get better before finals start.  I would really appreciate it, and if you've got a shift you need covered during finals week, I'll do my best to help out.

        Thank you,

        Ryan
