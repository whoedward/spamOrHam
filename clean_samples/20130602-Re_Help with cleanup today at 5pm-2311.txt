Sorry I am currently driving back from Navy Pier and traffic is pretty heavy, so I won't be back in time to clean up.

    Hey guys,

    There was a miscommunication and a missed clean-up in the Great Room this Friday. The Great Room opens again today at 5pm during my shift, but there's a dance event happening at the same time that Juan and I should be here for. Could someone help us by cleaning up the Great Room? (You'd get offsite pay!)

    Please respond whether or not you can do this.

    Thanks,
    Tim
