Hey guys,

My apologies but I forgot to mention that I will not be at the meeting tonight.  We have a mandatory all-chapter workshop with the Nationals officer visiting my sorority this week.  Let me know if there's anything I can try to help cover.  I'll be sure to update the agenda with anything needed.

~Christina
