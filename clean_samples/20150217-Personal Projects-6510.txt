Hi Chris,

Michael mentioned briefly during my performance review a side project that I was working on for NTS.
In addition to that project (which is focused mainly on inventory), there are one or two other ideas that I have for software solutions to some of our common needs.

With that in mind, would you be interested in meeting some time this week to talk about these things? If so, plesae let me know when you are free over the next few days.

Best,
Ethan
