Hey everyone,

Here's a little advice that hopefully you all find helpful when working Ryan events. I'm not sure if some of you already do this but something that might be helpful is that before leaving from Norris to Ryan Auditorium, check the sheets and take down the number of the contact person for the Ryan event. 

I say this because I was supposed to work a Ryan event today at 4pm so at 3:30 I gave the event contact person a call to figure out when they planned on showing up and apparently the event was cancelled. This obviously saved me a lot of time and I didn't have to play the waiting game with these guys and I can now return to sleeping.

Moral of the story: if you want to go back to bed earlier, check and see if your Ryan event is cancelled.

Hopefully this was useful advice but other than that happy Saturday everyone!
