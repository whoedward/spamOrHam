Hello, lovely ISRCers!

As Thomas said, there's a MANDATORY OPEN EXEC meeting TONIGHT AT 8:30 in the main lounge.  I hope to see you all there!  And if you want to be on philanthropy committee this quarter (it's okay if you weren't on it last quarter), or if you're doing DM, you should REALLY be there tonight. :)  In addition to important info shared at open exec, I will have an informal philanthropy committee/DM meeting immediately afterwards in order to cover some stuff in more detail.  Thanks!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
