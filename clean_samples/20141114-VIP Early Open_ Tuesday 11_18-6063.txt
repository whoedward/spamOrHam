Hello,

A big conference for the Provosts office was added to the schedule.  This means for Alex Y. and Nathan, there is an early open at 7AM this coming Tuesday. 

The event goes from 7AM-3:30PM.  So Didi, Adrick, Alex Y., Nathan, Phoebe, Juan, Michael, Alexandra, and Alex Z., you must dress VIP, meaning a Norris polo and slacks, or business casual.  Be on your A game!!

If you have any questions, please email the supervisors.

Best,
Christina
