Hi Mary,

Sorry for the delayed response. Mike and I can make it into your office with the relevant information and fees on Monday, February 10th (2/10/14). We should be there in the afternoon. If that time does not work for you, or if you have any questions, please let me know what I can do to help.

Best,
Ethan Robison
