Hi NTS,

We just had a Ryan Event come up for tomorrow from 5-11pm. If you can take all/part of the event, just reply to the email. You won't have to worry about missing the meeting tomorrow.

We don't know where the meeting will be tomorrow, but be on the lookout for an email tomorrow morning, the time is as usual, 7-8pm.

Thanks,

Alex
