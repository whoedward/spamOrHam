Hello All,

Two important things:
1) There has been a hiccup with the plotter in the library, it is currently out-of-service. I know they're working on fixing it, expect an update later today. In light of this fact, the "extended" printing office hours scheduled today from 1-2p are canceled.

2)
I'm collecting everyone's posters, so we have them on file to project on the big screen during the awards ceremony.

**Please have someone from your team email me your final poster file in .jpeg form, named like so:**

SECTION#_TEAM#_LAST NAME
Example: 6_2_schwartz.jpeg

Please do this by noon on Friday, if I don't receive your poster, there will be nothing to show everyone if you win!
