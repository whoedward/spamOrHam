Ok, I told her that she might just have to drastically reduce her hours.  Should I tell her that's all she can do?

    Well she could ask Chris to put her on regular pay, but I think he's running out of money to pay people out of NTS's pocket.

        Hey Christine,

        So I was just informed today that I am approaching my Work Study Allotment, and cannot ask for an increase. Is there any way Norris can help with this issue? If not, I will have to reduce my hours at Norris to two hours a week most likely, in order to spread my allotment over the whole quarter. If there is anything else I can do, please let me know.

        All the best,
