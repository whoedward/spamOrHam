Hi all,
Todoroki can only make a reservation as early as noon on Friday, March 13th. This email is to inform you all that the social will now be held at noon on Friday, March 13th. I apologize if this changes anyone's availability.

The e-mail for sign ups will still come out tomorrow at 8pm. Keep your eyes peeled!
Paul

    Hey all,
    We'll be heading to Todoroki for all you can eat sushi next Friday, March 13th at 11:30AM.

    I'll be sending out an email this Thursday at 8 pm to sign up for spots. Right now I'm thinking first 30 to reply, but as always I'm sure I'll be lenient on that.

    Best,
    Paul Kim
