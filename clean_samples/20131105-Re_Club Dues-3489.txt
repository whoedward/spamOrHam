Fun fact. Apparently basketball starts tomorrow, which means I'm in basketball band again, starting tomorrow. This means I won't be at practice. Please give any money to Natalie. Thanks.

        Hey guys,

        If you could please respond to me with a yes or no as to whether or not you've already paid your dues, that'd be great. I want to make sure my list is correct. Also, don't lie to me, because uncool, man. Between the dues I've already collected, and a little supplement from the money we made working concessions, we'll cover our dues to the studio, without having to dip into the funds we have in our account!
