Hello all you fantastic, wonderful people,

Would it be at all possible for somebody to cover my closing shift (10-midnight) tonight?  I've got an econ midterm and a history paper due tomorrow, and I could use the extra time to prepare.  I can't make it to the meeting tonight, so I'm sending this out now.

If not, I can work the shift; I just thought I'd offer it to all of you in want of hours.  Money!

Many thanks,

Ryan
