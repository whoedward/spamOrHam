Hello,

I did manage to find the amplitudes in the manner that you and Dr. Kath suggested, but I am not sure how to find the natural resonant frequencies from my graphs. From the way that things look, there is no change in amplitude that appears to be at any frequency. If I instead plot time versus amplitude, I merely get a horizontal line.

It seems that my amplitude is remaining constant with time.

I get the feeling that this is not exactly right.

If there are any pointers that you could give me, I would greatly appreciate them.

Best,
Ethan Robison

    That's exactly what I'm expecting. Ethan, please let us know if you have any remaining questions.

You can then on the resonance curve identify the natural frequencies that were found.  Is that consistent with what you're expecting, Avy?
