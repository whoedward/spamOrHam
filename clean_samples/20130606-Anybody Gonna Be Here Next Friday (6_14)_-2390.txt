8-10 am...
2-6 pm...

Two lovely shifts looking for coverage on the last day of Finals' Week.  I myself will finish with finals by Tuesday afternoon at the latest, and have already accepted that I will simply have to work my Wednesday open as I am sure no one will cover it (unless anyone would like to prove me wrong???).  

Would someone be good enough to take my Friday shifts?  I would appreciate it with ten times more appreciation than normal since I have been branded a traitor and an outcast for having made the switch to CM for next year.  Shaaaaame on me, shame.  I'll miss you all regardless.  I've never seen a more cohesive staff with personality to boot. 

Happy Studying in the Meantime!

Marina
