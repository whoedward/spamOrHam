Hey, guys,

I just wanted to let you guys know that even though there is DM going on tomorrow, we will still have our usual practice tomorrow. Natalie and I won't be there, but there will be a couple of other black belt members to help out with things tomorrow. For those who are doing DM…….. good luck :)

Yours,
Davin
