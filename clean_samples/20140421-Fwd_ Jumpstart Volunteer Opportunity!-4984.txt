Hi everyone,

Welcome to another week of volunteering with Jumpstart NU! 

Here are some fun, low-commitment opportunities that we will be hosting soon. All spots are first come, first serve, so hit 'REPLY' asap!

 

Book Buddies at the Evanston Public Library

1703 Orrington Ave, Evanston IL

Weekly (Fridays) 3:30pm-5pm. Available THIS Friday 04/25!

 Join us at the Evanston Public Library children's area at 3:30pm to read to kids for an afternoon! You'll receive a brief orientation about reading strategies with young children. Then there will be group story time and after that you'll get to read in small groups with your book buddies! The afternoon will end with an activity that relates to the theme of the week. Email me, Diamanta Panford, (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) to reserve your spot!


Best,
Diamanta Panford
