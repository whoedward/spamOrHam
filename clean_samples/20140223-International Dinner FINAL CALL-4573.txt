Hi!

If you haven't yet signed up for a time to cook or haven't yet prepared your dish, you need to get started RIGHT AWAY. Please come down to the main lounge to retrieve your ingredients and cookware. Thank you for your cooperation! If you are no longer attending, please let me know, so we don't think your dish is missing when we are checking people in.

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
