Hi guys,

There was a confusion about this Saturday's practice today, but Blom IS open till 2pm on Oct 5th!! So we will have a practice this Saturday. We will focus on individual skills and any other things you would like to work on. If you are a beginner or if you want personal coaching, I strongly encourage you to come out.

Have a good night!!
Natalie Kim
