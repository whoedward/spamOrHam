Hello everyone! 

Hope you are all having enjoyable and relaxing breaks! I just wanted to send along a couple of reminders as winter vacation draws to a close:

1) FINAL DESIGNS - Final design presentations are in one week! Lead designers/directors, please be prepared to present your final designs at our prod meeting on Sunday, January 5 @ 10:30 in the Big 10 Room. As always, all are welcome and encouraged to come! I'd love to have as many people there as possible. Lead designers: the following day, we have final design presentations to L&M at around 10:30 in Norris. I will send specific info in the next few days with exact meeting time and location. 

2) MERCH - You all have less than a week to buy some really classy Caesar long sleeve shirts for only $14! Buy your merch here: http://teespring.com/juliuscaesar 

3) INDIEGOGO/BAKESALE/BUILD - Besides final designs, we have a very exciting and eventful first week back from break. We will be launching our Indiegogo campaign, having our first bake sale at the Rock, and our first weekend of BUILD! Stay tuned for more information and sign-ups.

Thank you all so much for your dedication to this project so far. I can't wait to hit the ground running in January and make all of your incredible work a reality! Happy New Year!

Sincerely,
Matt
