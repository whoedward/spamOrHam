Hi guys, I was unable to get my 12-2 shift covered today because just about every tech has class at that time save Ethan, John, and I so I am still coming in, but from the looks of it I may be a few minutes late. 

I'm picking up equipment for my film this weekend as traffic is looking pretty hairy. 

Hopefully that is not the case, but I wanted to let you two know just in case I'm not there right at 12.
