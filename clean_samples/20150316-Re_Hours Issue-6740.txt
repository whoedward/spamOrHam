Hi Chris,

Thank you for taking this seriously. We will definitely keep an eye out for anything of note.
Best,

    Ethan,
    Thank you for alerting me. This is steeling from the university, as well as from the federal work study program, and I take that very seriously. And it also effects us all when this person runs out of hours prematurely.

    I ask that you all help me keep an eye on this moving forward. I'll keep a close eye on time sheets.
