Hey all,

So, I forgot I was performing in Harmony Fest today during my 4-6pm shift. I thought we were on at 3 and would be done by 4. My group actually goes on at 4ish but we won't take more than 15 minutes, so if anyone could cover the first hour I would be super super grateful. The performance is in McCormick so I should be able to take over by 445. 

Thanks,
Tim
