I am not, but we will talk about it at the meeting tomorrow and get a super or an experienced tech on that.

    Hey Supers,

    I have a shift available on Sunday 3/1, from 6:30pm-8:30pm.  Need someone with experience over there (aka one of you) to cover it while the Satellite staff have a meeting.  Anyone available?
