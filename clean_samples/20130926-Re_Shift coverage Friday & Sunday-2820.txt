    Hey guys,

    I'll be out of town this weekend, leaving early morning Friday for a business conference in Kentucky, and I won't be back til Sunday night. So, if somebody could cover my Friday noon - 2 shift and my Sunday 10 - 6, I would be so grateful and would be willing to cover shifts in return. I'll put them up for grabs on the shift planning site tonight, for now please email me if you can take any of the shifts. Thank you! Hope everybody is having a good start to the year!

    Best,
    Jake Degler
