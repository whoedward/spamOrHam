Hi All,
So this Friday, there is going to be a Fellows Social at 4:15 in the main lounge. In honor of the ongoing Golden Week Holidays in Japan, there will be heaps of sushi as well as mochi ice cream! 

I will need people to assist with getting invitations to professors. The document for sign up is here:

Please put your name in Column D next to the professor you're delivering to. I will place the invites under your door tomorrow.      I will love you forever if you help me with this. 
Forever is a reeeally long time. 

Also, I will need three people to meet me in the lobby at 3:55 of ISRC to help me carry the sushi platters back as well as set up for the social. Note: this increases your chance of getting first dibs. Think about it. I will also need three people to assist with clean up. Email me back if you would like to sign up for set up/take down. 

Each invitation delivered or sign up for set up/take down will grant you one service point.
 
See you guys there!

Best Regards,
