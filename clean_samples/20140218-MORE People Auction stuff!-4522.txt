Hello, lovely ISRCers!

First of all, congratulations to the recently-elected exec board members!  I know they will all do a great job. :)

Second of all, this is a friendly reminder that bidding on the ISRC People Auction closes at 11:59pm on Sunday, Feb. 23!

Philanthropy points clarification:  For each talent/service you submit to the auction (AND YOU CAN STILL SUBMIT), you get one philanthropy point.  If you bid on anything, you also get a philanthropy point.  For bidding, however, the limit is one point, regardless of how many things you bid on or how many times you bid on a given thing.

Happy Tuesday!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
