Hey everyone,

Remember that when you are responding to shift changes to please Reply All to the email so it gets cc'd to the NTS listserv. We had some confusion over multiple people taking a shift today because they didn't not Reply All, and nobody knew the shift was already covered.

Furthermore, please remember to update ShiftPlanning to reflect any changes in schedule.

From,
Michael
