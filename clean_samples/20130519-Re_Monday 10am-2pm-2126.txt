Is nobody able to take either of these?  I'd really appreciate the help.

    Hey folks,

    I'd like to offer my Monday shifts (10-noon and noon-2) to anyone who wants them - either or both.
    I've got both an econ midterm and a paper due Tuesday morning, so I'd really appreciate having the extra time.

    Thanks,

    Ryan
