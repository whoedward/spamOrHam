Hey,

Just reminding you guys of tonight's social at Jihoon's apt. Meet at 1930 Ridge Ave, Apt C307.
There will be plenty of food and we'll probably order pizza. Bring some cash to help pitch in if you're not bringing any food/drink.

See all of you soon!

Andrew

    Come by for a good time and get closer to others in the club! We'll be doing fun things.

    Right now, we're looking at making it a potluck. Also, BYOB. More details to come.
