Hey, guys,

A couple of things today:

First off, don't forget that we have practice today at our usual time and place (8:00 P.M. ~ 10:00 P.M. at Blomquist). We're going to try to focus more on forms over these next few Mondays, so come on out and join us.

Secondly, the $40 club dues will be collected starting today. Please make the check out to Northwestern University and hand it to Joanna when you see her during practice.

Lastly, we have two tournaments coming up next month (one on 11/16 and another on 11/23) that we can choose to participate in. Because they are on back-to-back weekends, we will in all likelihood only make one of the tournaments. If you are interested in participating, please fill out the spreadsheet (Google Doc) that Eric emailed earlier so that we can decide by the end of this week which tournament we will go to. More information on tournaments will come up later.

That is it for now. I hope to see you guys all at practice. The quarter is half done, so let's keep pressing on!

Yours truly,
Davin
