Hey everyone,

Attached are copies of the belt test application form. One is for 2nd degree black belt testing. The other is for normal belt testing. If you don't have one already and are planning to test, you can print out the appropriate form. Make sure to circle your current belt, not the belt you are testing for. If you don't like crookedly scanned applications, you can pick up one of the original copies from me during the practices leading up to the belt test. You should also have your belt test fees ready on the day of the test. Checks should be made out to "Tiger Martial Arts." Specific fee information is included on the application and will vary by belt.

The test will be next Wednesday, March 13. Testing starts at 8:30 PM sharp, so be there early (say 8 PM) to get warmed up and stretched out. Also, during the test, please remember your "yes sir" and "no sir"s. Loud, clear and confident. The same goes for ki-haps. If your name is called up, say "yes sir," stand up, and walk to the center of the mats.

Cool. Good luck with the test and see you all Saturday.

Ji-hoon
