Happy Sunday NU TRI! 

You survived the first week of the season!  Congratulations!

The training plans for next week are now up on the web site.  Please scroll to the plan that fits you best and go from there.  Remember, the bike workout for Wednesday will be done at spin practice on Wednesday night at 8pm so don't worry about completing that one on your own.   Coach Brett has requested that you do not go onto the intermediate or elite plan if you have no prior endurance sport experience.  Email him or any of exec if you have questions regarding which plan you should follow.

The Weekly Tri for this week is up on the web site!!   

Rich has a brown leather jacket at his apt left from the party... let him know if it's yours.

that's all for now,
Anna B
