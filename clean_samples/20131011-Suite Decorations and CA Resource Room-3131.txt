Hey y'all!

So a few of you have been asking to go into the CA resource room where there is butcher paper, construction paper, glitter, shapes, and all sorts of fun stuff to decorate your suite for the Country Suite Decoration Competition that will be judged on Tuesday for the various countries. I will be leaving at 4 pm today in the main lounge to make a trip to the resource room. You can send one person from your suite to grab materials from the resource room. Make sure you figure out what you want and who will go by four!

Have a good day!,
Hali
