Hello Everyone!

The Student Employment Committee will host the next Norris Town Hall on Monday, February 24th at 4:30pm in the Northwestern Room (Norris Rm 202)! We'll be sending out an agenda soon. In the meantime, please respond to this email if you have any specific announcements you would like to make. 

Remember, the Town Hall provides you with an opportunity to have your voice heard as a staff member of Norris as well as to learn about upcoming events in Norris and around Northwestern. So come join the conversation!

Also, if you are interested in helping us plan the March Town Hall (which will be held during reading week), please email me at dominique.baser@northwestern.edu. We would love to have your input!

Best, 

Dominique
