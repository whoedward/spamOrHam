ChemEs,

Elections take place tomorrow at 6pm in Tech LG72. Please prepare (or just wing it) a 1-2 minute speech. Even if you are not running for a position I strongly encourage you to attend to support your friends as any ChemE can vote.

If you are running for a position and are unable to attend you must let me know and send me a short blurb for me to read out loud as to why you are a good fit for the position.

May the odds be ever in your favor,
Mark
