On Friday evening at 4, I invite you all to investigate a mystery that has haunted ISRC since DM. I can't say much, but you will find out more information on the crime if you agree to take part in the investigation. 

This will be a chill game to play to investigate a mystery most foul. Please reply to this email if you want to participate. Indicate your level of interest as well-- do you just want to investigate or would you like a role as one of the suspects? This is important so that I know how to assign characters and the suspects out for the game.

Thank you and have a lovely (Reading) Week!
