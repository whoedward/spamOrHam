What's up y'all It's Paul Kim Kardashian here with some details on an upcoming social for Saturday.
We're going to Rice N Bread, a Korean/Korean fusion diner in Wrigleyville then going to see the Del Tones (Improv musical) at the Improv Olympic theater. I'm planning to leave at 4:30 and getting back at about 10:30. Dinner and the show will be fully subsidized, but you will pay for your own transportation. There's 8 spots open right now; this can be expanded if needed. I'll be sending out the email for spots at 9:00 tomorrow night. Keep your eyes peeled.
Thanks guys
Paul kim
