Hey so I can't make the meeting tonight. I'm on my way to Georgia for my uncle's funeral and won't be back til Saturday. Sorry to do this for a second week in a row but i'll need my thursday 6 to 8 and friday 4 to 8 covered. Shiftplanning is being weird on my phone/my service isn't that great right now so i can't release them at the moment.

Kara
