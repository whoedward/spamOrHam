Hey Nelson,

The supers and I have noticed that you haven't been to any of the meetings lately, and Phoebe mentioned that you might be involved in the same dance group as Jolo, who has a recurring conflict.
Please make sure to let us know if you do have any sort of conflict (so that we know where you are).
If you do not have a conflict, I'd like to remind you that meeting attendance is mandatory.
If you have any questions, please ask me or email ntssupervisors@gmail.com with your issues!

Regards,
Ethan
