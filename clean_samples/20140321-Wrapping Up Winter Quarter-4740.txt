Good Morning,
 
As we near the end of the quarter, I hope this e-mail finds you well as you have finished finals or are almost there! Before leaving this quarter behind I would encourage you to take a moment and reflect on your experiences with your instructors and courses this quarter. 
 
We understand that a thoughtful CTEC requires time to complete, and the past weeks have been undoubtedly busy as we all wrap up final exams, papers, presentations, projects, theses, and more. Please keep the following in mind as the deadline nears this Sunday. 
•  I know it is difficult to see how CTECs are used but some of your Professors do actually wait to read the considerate feedback you provide them and begin to adjust their courses accordingly for the next set of Northwestern students taking the course. 
•  To potentially make it easier and quicker for you to formulate your opinions to include in the form, I would encourage you to glance at the syllabus for your course and pin point what specific parts of your class worked and what areas could use improvement. 
Please take the opportunity that CTECs give you to evaluate where your Professor’s teaching needs to improve by logging on to CAESAR here: http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar. 
 
I hope you can find time to fill them out as the week comes to an end. Otherwise, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback—I’m happy to help as best I can!
 
Wishing you a nice, restful Spring Break!
 
Sofia Sami,
ASG VP of Academics
