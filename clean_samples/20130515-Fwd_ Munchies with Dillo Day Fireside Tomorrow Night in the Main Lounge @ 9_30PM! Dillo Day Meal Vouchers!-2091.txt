Hey Nathan,
Can you send this to the ISRC Listserv ASAP? Thanks! Claire 

Hey ISRC,
So every year, NEMO (Northwestern Emergency Medicine Organization) puts on fun, interactive firesides that will give you all the information you need to know about Dillo Day! We will be combining this fireside with munchies tomorrow night in the main lounge at 9:30PM (5/15), so come on down, grab some eats, and get pumped for Dillo!!!!!!!!
