Hey all,

Forgot about how everything is happening tomorrow night so as an EDIT: Emails for spots will be sent out at 6:45 PM tomorrow evening, to avoid the tutorial, Adam Devine, and munchies/ASG candidates conflicts.

Sorry about that, and thank you,
Paul Kim

    What's up y'all It's Paul Kim Kardashian here with some details on an upcoming social for Saturday.
    We're going to Rice N Bread, a Korean/Korean fusion diner in Wrigleyville then going to see the Del Tones (Improv musical) at the Improv Olympic theater. I'm planning to leave at 4:30 and getting back at about 10:30. Dinner and the show will be fully subsidized, but you will pay for your own transportation. There's 8 spots open right now; this can be expanded if needed. I'll be sending out the email for spots at 9:00 tomorrow night. Keep your eyes peeled.
    Thanks guys
    Paul kim
