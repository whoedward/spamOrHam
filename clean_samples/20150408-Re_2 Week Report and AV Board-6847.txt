Thanks for that extra column of notes on the AV Board; that helps us a ton!  Just one question: on Shiftplanning there is an Equipment Pickup 10:30AM-11:30PM on Sunday 4/12 -- is that picking up equipment from Shanley at 11:30 or midnight?  Or are they bringing the equipment back themselves?

Thanks,
Christina
