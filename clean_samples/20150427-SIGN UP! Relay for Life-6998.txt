Hey guys!

It is still not too late to sign up for this year's Relay for Life event! The event is May 15th from 6pm to 6am! There are going to be a ton of games and activities for us to do together. 

I'd like for Team Pineapple to have a strong presence, so please sign up! All you need to do is pay a $10 registration fee! :) 

Please support ISRC! It will be fun.

Nina
