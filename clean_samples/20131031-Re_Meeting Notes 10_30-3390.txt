Sorry about that!  

Midterms are getting the best of me.  Here is the AV Board as well:  https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdF9SS3Z6R2VHRzBiUXlZM3dIZXlCLXc&usp=drive_web#gid=0

Jake Degler would also like his Sunday 12-2 PM covered, so if someone can jump on that you will be on my A+ list!

Good luck studying, everyone!

    Hey Everyone,

    Christina accidentally sent out the wrong link for the training doc, the correct one is

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvQIpwGAfXUpdHNsS3MtZFFiODd4WW9FSEJacW9tSnc&usp=sharing

    Please make sure to sign up for either session - this is required training.

    Also, I cannot do my shift from 6-8pm next Wed - I've put the shift up on Shiftplanning but I'm sending it out over the listserv too.

    Thanks,
