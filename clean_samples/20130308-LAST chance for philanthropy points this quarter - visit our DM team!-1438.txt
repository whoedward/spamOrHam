Hi everyone,
 
As we speak, our DM team is working at dancing away their 30 hours!  To show them some ISRC love, I will be leading a group of people to visit them at about 2:30 PM tomorrow.  We will bring them some snacks and check up on how they're doing.
 
Coming to visit our DM team is worth a philanthropy point.  We will meet in ISRC's front lobby and then walk over together at around 2:20 PM tomorrow.  It costs $5 to get into the tent as a visitor, so please make sure you have money with you!
 
If you'd like to bake something to give to our DM team, that is also worth a philanthropy point.
 
As always, let me know if you have any questions!
 
Sincerely,
 
Emily
