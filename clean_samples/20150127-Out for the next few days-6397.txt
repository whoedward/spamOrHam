Hey guys,

So I got really sick last night and got sent to the emergency room today. I probably won't be able to get back to school until next Monday at the earliest. If you guys could get all my shifts covered that'd be great. I hope this counts as a good enough excuse for missing the meeting tomorrow =p.

Alex
