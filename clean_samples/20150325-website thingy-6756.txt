Heyyyyy

Thank you for helping~
So i'll send you the folder in like.. 3 hours or whatever but what I need on the website is the endorsement page to work like this example.

http://groups.northwestern.edu/anialexforasg/index.php/endorsements/

So on the website I'm making, there's a page called "endorsements" and I have square images as icons.. and when you click on the image, it should have a popup box that describes the people & their statement of endorsement or whatever w/ the background shadowed/darkened..

To start off with, there will be 30 of those boxes with different groups/people in each of them and we should be able to add more throughout the campaign.. 

I'm guessing using a loop w/ an array of info or something but w/e works haha

Let me know if this makes or does not make sense....

:)

Phoebe
