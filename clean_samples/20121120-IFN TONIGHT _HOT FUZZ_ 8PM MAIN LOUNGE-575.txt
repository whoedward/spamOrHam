Hey ISRCers,

Happy Thanksgiving ! Tonight, we are going to watch a hilarious British crime-comedy called "Hot Fuzz" starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of Shaun of the Dead fame. Also, don't forget Academic and Fellow Committee Meeting ! So come and take a break after all your midterms and papers ! 

See you there,
Arkar
