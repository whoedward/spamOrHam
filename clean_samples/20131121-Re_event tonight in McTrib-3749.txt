Hi Michael,

I'm part of McSA, so I'll be at the event tonight. I can go ahead set up and work for the whole event, if the offer is still available.

    Michael,

    I told Baber- the student who needs PA set up in Mctrib your offer.  He is going to see if he can get early access to McTrib in order to let you in early.

    So basically, stand by for more details.

     

    Thanks,

    If the offer's still open, I can set it up and stick around for sound check, but I have to leave at 6 PM.
