Hey Guys,

I found a rather mangled VGA in the McCormick booth this morning. So, as a reminder, I would like to stress the importance of coiling and stowing cables properly whenever possible. Additionally, remember that we have storage space in the McCormick booth (so there really is no reason to leave something out in there).

Finally, if you are on shift, it is your responsibility to make sure that the spaces around Norris are clean and secure. In other words, make sure to wander around the building once or twice per shift to make sure that things are put away and locked up.

Best,
Ethan Robison
