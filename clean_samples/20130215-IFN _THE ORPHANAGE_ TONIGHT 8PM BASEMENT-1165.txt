Hey ISRCers,

For IFN tonight, we will be watching a Spanish horror film "The Orphanage" (El Orfanato) produced by Guillermo del Toro, critically-acclaimed director of "Pan's Labyrinth". The movie won seven Goya Awards (Spanish equivalent of Academy Awards) and received various critical claims. Come enjoy this great movie at 8PM in the basement ! 

See you then,
Arkar
