For returning techs: This training is required for EVERYONE, and for the more experienced techs we'll be doing training on some of the more advanced parts of our job. 

For new techs: Welcome! We'll be going over all of the basics of our job and introducing you more to what NTS does and Norris overall. 

This is Paid training, so you can swipe in, and we will try to have some food for you at each training date. 

We look forward to seeing you,
NTS Supervisors
