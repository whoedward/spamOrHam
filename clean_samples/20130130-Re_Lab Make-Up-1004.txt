Hello Dr. Priest,

My lab partner and I would like to reschedule for the Thursday afternoon lab that week (2 p.m. until 6 p.m.). My lab partner is Kyle Tsai, and he is also available that day.

Thanks,
Ethan Robison

    Dear Ethan,
    Your request for rescheduling a lab has been granted.   What we need to do now is find another day,  during the same week as the lab you are missing,  when you can make up the lab.   This quarter, labs run Monday through Friday and there is a Wednesday night section that begins at 6 a clock p.m.

    The best thing to do is to check with your lab partner and see if they can do the switch with you.   If they can,  you both can still work together on the lab we are rescheduling.   If they cannot,  you will both probably have performed the experiment by yourselves,  as we cannot put either of you into a team of 3.

    After checking with your partner,  please get back to me, let me know if they can switch with you,  what their name is,  and what day you wish to switch to.
