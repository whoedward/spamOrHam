Hey ISRCers,

For IFN this week, we are going to watch a French movie called "The Class (Entre les murs)" at 8:30 PM in the main lounge. The movie is set on a middle school in Parisian suburb, portraying the relationship between a teacher and his "problem" kids. The film has garnered positive critical claims, and it was nominated for the Academy Award in 2008. Here is a link for the trailer and reviews: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_class/.  Also, don't forget our Academic/Fellow meeting at 8 PM. So come to the meeting and enjoy the movie afterward.

See you there,
Arkar
