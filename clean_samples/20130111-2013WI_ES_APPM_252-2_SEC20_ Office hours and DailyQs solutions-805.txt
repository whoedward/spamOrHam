All,

Two things:

Based on the online poll, I'll be holding office hours on Thursdays from 1-3pm in the ESAM small conference room (4th floor, sort of across from Prof. Silber's office).

DailyQs solutions will be posted in the Assignments/DailyQs folder in Blackboard (where you go to take the quizzes) starting Monday at 9:00am. I think I'll make the previous week's solutions available every Monday from now on.

Have a great weekend!

Karna
