Hi guys,

As promised, here is an email to set up a four-way meeting this week between set, lights, props and costumes to talk about color palettes/visuals. Please fill out this Doodle by Monday at midnight. These dates are based on when Maia is free this week. Our goal is to be able to settle on a date when all lead designers are available, and then choose a date when the most assistant designers are free because we would love to keep everyone in the loop as much as possible.

Thanks everyone! Let me know if you have any questions.

All the best,
Matt
