9PAY

Reminder: New Applications for 2013-14 (deadline extended)

Dear Students and Parents or Other Guests:

The Office of Student Accounts is ready to help you with any questions that you may have about tuition invoices and payments.

You may also read these instructions online, where you will see Related Links, How Do I? and a menu of important Payments and Billing topics.

9PAY, a tuition and fee installment payment option for Northwestern University undergraduate students will be available for the new academic year. Tuition, room and board charges and fees are normally due at the start of each term (September 1 for the fall quarter, January 1 for the winter quarter and April 1 for the spring quarter). 9PAY is designed to help you pay for educational expenses on a convenient monthly basis instead of through larger quarterly payments.

You may apply for 9PAY online. Students or their authorized Guests will log into CAESAR and click on 'Apply for 9PAY' under the More Student Financials section (or Guest Menu) of the Home page. The application, terms and conditions, a worksheet to determine the installment plan amount, and payment options are available online. Please follow the step-by-step instructions, noted below, to submit your 9PAY application online for immediate processing. You will receive an email to confirm that your application was received.

Please note the June 1st application deadline has been extended to June 29. We realize room assignments may not be made until mid-May or later and financial aid awards may not be confirmed until early summer. The following figures will be useful to calculate your Annual Budgeted Amount (ABA) in the 'Apply for 9PAY' worksheet:
Tuition 	$45,120 	
Associated Student Government Activity fee 	$162 	
Athletic Events fee (fall charge only) 	$45 	
Student Heath fee 	$200 	
Average room and board charges 	$13,862 	*
Student Health Insurance plan 	$3,067 	
* 	The actual room and board charges will vary depending on the room assignment and board plan selected. The amount does not include dorm social dues.

Any difference between the estimated charges and credits and the actual charges can be paid upon receipt of the normal fall, winter and spring invoices. Calling the Housing Office or the Financial Aid Office will hinder the issuing of room assignments and financial aid awards for all students, so we encourage you to review your information carefully.

We hope you find 9PAY to be a useful tool in paying the educational expenses for your son or daughter. Addition information about 9PAY can be found at www.northwestern.edu/sfs/payments/9PAY/. Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have about 9PAY.

Sincerely,
Office of Student Accounts
