​640 Lincoln Street, the art building. Shall I tell her she can expect us then? We will have to use their desktop computer. Is that okay with you?

            I will be available, and it would be really cool if you could come as well! (This is the art showcase thing.)

            I think we got you covered. Josh is looking in to it. What's your availability next Thursday 3/5 afternoon for install. Could you come by the art building at either 11:50pm or 3:50 pm?

            It runs mainly using terminal (on any computer) and Sublime Text 2. I would just need a Mac laptop and a simple desk. I would love it if you could locate a loaner for me.

                Hi Kylee,

                That's great news.  I imagine you would want a laptop to run the piece and a desk/chair?  What program does it run on?  I can see if we have a loaner laptop so you don't have to use/leave yours. 

                Let me know!
                Allison

                Allison Wade, 
                I'm terribly sorry for the delay in response. I had to check with Frank (Ethan Robinson), and he said he would love to put it on display. We would be incredibly excited to show our project; is it too late to get this started? 

                Thank you, 
                Kylee Grant

                        Hi Kylee,

                        Hope your quarter is going well.  I am writing to see if you and your collaborator wanted to put your final piece from sculpture last quarter in the Art Department open house taking place March 6 from 10-5.  If you are interested, we can discuss the possibility of finding a loaner laptop.

                        Best,
                        Allison
