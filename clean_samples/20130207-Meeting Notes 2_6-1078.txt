Hi guys,

Here are the meeting notes from last night.

Announcements

There will be a pizza party at next week's meeting!

Mid-Year Evaluations are coming up. We will be putting out a Google Doc with out available times, so be on the lookout for that. They shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes, and you need to complete one in order to continue working with NTS.

If you have any equipment that you are uncomfortable setting up, don't hesitate to email us or ask Michael on shift to show you how to set it up.
