Hey everyone,

I knew I forgot something at open exec! I will be holding points appeals during Reading Week. This time, I have a few uncertainties regarding points, so if you feel like you should have more points recorded or more points than you actually should have (shhhhhhhh), then e-mail me so we can set a time to talk about it. I will also meet with anyone who would like to talk to me about concerns regarding living here again next year. The housing director likes to work with the previous VP, so I'm going to be the guy you need to talk to about housing early on next quarter.

Let me know if you'd like to talk!
Thomas
