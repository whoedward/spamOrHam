As in, the 6:45 time-slot. ;D  There's still some spots left, I think!

                This is great everyone, keep 'em coming (and remember to "REPLY ALL" so we don't overlap!). 

                I like how everyone is keeping at least a 15-minute interval in between every appointment--please continue to do so. 

                Also, FYI:  Max Zhang has the 2:00 pm--the next available time should be around 2:15, all the way until 4 pm (I have a section at this time).

                Again people, keep up the good work!

                Thanks,

                                It's that time again!  Everyone must complete a Spring Evaluation in order to qualify for a (drumroll please...) 5 cent raise!  At least I think it's 5 cents...

                                But you must do your eval!  IT SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AT THE MOST.  Wednesday is my designated day this week:  if you would like to just blast this thing out of the way, I will available:

                                Wednesday, 5/29
                                2-4 pm
                                6-7 pm
                                8-9 pm

                                Email me with a time (and reply all so that we don't overlap), and I'll meet you in the Tech Lounge.

                                Let's get pumped people!
