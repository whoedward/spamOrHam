It looks great (and will definitely reduce lost equipment)!

Some random ideas I thought about (you've probably thought of some of these already though):

    Automatic time stamping (more accurate, would reduce hassle and possibility of error/falsification)
    Check-in or out buttons for most common equipment (press a button on the excel sheet to check out one DI box per click, for example)
    A drop-down list of techs, with the techs who are on shift at the top (I imagine you can do this by having the computer in the lab sync with the schedule on the NTS Google Drive and using Excel's internal clock to match the time to the techs on duty, this is just me talking though)

It's looking pretty good.

It is by no means finished (I have ambitions for this bad boy), but I'd love to hear what you guys think so far. Anything from color schemes to missing features to rearrangements. Positive comments and constructive criticisms are encouraged!
