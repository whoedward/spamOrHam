Hello again,

I'm thinking of switching BJJ practice to Sundays either from 11-1pm or from 3-5pm.

For each time, please let me know if this will:
1)Make it easier for you to attend practice
2)Make it harder/impossible for you to attend practice 
3)Make no difference
4)Force you to sell all of your belongings, move to Brazil and start training BJJ full time.

Please let me know as soon as possible. (Like today if you can)

Thanks,
Jacob
