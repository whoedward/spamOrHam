Hey Magan, thanks for letting us know and trying to work around it. Class is a completely excusable conflict, so we understand. Please just make sure to read the meeting notes each week to stay in the loop.

    Hi Supervisors,

    I'm really sorry for the late email, but the reason I wasn't able to go to the meeting is because I had lab from 6-8 PM. I tried to go switch my lab section, but the only available spot at the time was in conflict with my other EECS lab. So I don't think I'll be able to go to future meetings. I'm sorry again. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

    Best,

    -Magan
