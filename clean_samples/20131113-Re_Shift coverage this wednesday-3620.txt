Hey Will,

I talked to the other supervisors about this, and we understand that we are students and academic comes first. It would be great if you could come in and check in with whoever is on shift with you. If everything is going fine and it's okay for the other person to be on the shift alone, its okay for you to go and meet with your team to work on the project. 

Thanks!
