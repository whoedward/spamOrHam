I have a class that ends at 6, so if I can be about 10-15 minutes late I can work it till 6-midnight.  If not, 8-midnight is fine too.

    Hey guys,

    Can anyone help me with my shifts next Thursday? They're from 6pm to 12am.
    I have tickets to a concert that I want to go to. I would be willing to trade shifts if my schedule permits.

    Thanks! Really appreciated!
    Leon
