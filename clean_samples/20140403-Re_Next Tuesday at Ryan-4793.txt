Alex and I will already be on shift at Norris for the close.  Is there anyone else who can do it?

    Hey folks,

    We just picked up a Ryan shift (A/V only).  We will be providing 2 Lav microphones in addition to the built ins.  Leave Norris at 6:30, set by 7pm, event starts at 7:30.  This is a Presidents office event so Iâ€™d like one of you to work it.

     

    Thanks,
