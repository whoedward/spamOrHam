Hey everyone,

The Kellogg demo is this Friday. We are going to meet in Blomquist at 4 PM on Friday and quickly go over the demo once. Aftewards, we will carry the black mats across the street to Kellogg. The actual demo is 5:45 so there will be plenty of time to prepare. Don't forget to bring your uniforms.

Also, we are being fed aftewards so look forward to that. There will also be demo practice this Saturday as well.

P.S. For the two people waiting on uniforms, don't worry. I haven't forgotten. The package has not arrived yet, but as soon as it does, I'll let you know.
