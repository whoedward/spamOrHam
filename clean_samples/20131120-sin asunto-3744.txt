Rehearsal Notes:

    We had another productive day of blocking! We had a lot of time to play with several of the scenes, and progress was made in everything.
    Tomorrow we’ll be working with Anjali and Selina, since we only have them for a limited time. We wanted to continue working into 2.2 with Caesar, but John is unavailable so we’ve decided to postpone until Saturday, to avoid jumping ahead to post-death scenes.

Scenery Notes:

    Maia has some new ideas after the four-way today—she’ll be getting in contact with you, Nikolaj, to meet and talk about some specifics

Prop Notes:

    Casca (Ali) may be carrying a knife/mace/pepper spray for beginning of scene 1.3
