Hi ISRCers,

There is one spot open for students for the Lunar New Year dining out at the Phoenix restaurant on Thurs., February 19 (campus departure 5:10 pm/ campus return 9:30 pm)!  Tickets cost $10 and the first student to sign up on the googledoc will get the spot: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13ybulEr9QqHcak0n-x_QQAX9KcBNw_s1UOk116URqvE/viewform?usp=send_form

Also, come by tomorrow to drink tea and hang out with me during Tuesday Teas at 12!  As a reminder, the two weekly ISRC Assistant Master events for winter quarter are:

    Tuesday Teas at 12 (12 - 2p in my office): come eat cookies, drink tea/coffee with me! BYOM (bring your own mug)
    Whiney Wednesdays (2 - 4p in my office): come eat meats, cheeses, and drink (non-alcoholic) wine while whining about your week with me! BYOG (bring your own glassware)

Thanks,

Jen
ISRC Assistant Master
