To:


Dear Class,
According to the most current syllabus, the deliverables below are due tomorrow. However, because I will be returning these drafts to you tomorrow, along with the other report/appendices you have been working on, let's change the due date until a week from tomorrow, February 12th. You already have quite a bit due this Thursday, and we can talk about the testing guides in class tomorrow.

In the meantime, kick that Graphics quiz today. Good luck!

Professor Herrick

Project deliverables
• Revised Project Definition (i.e. Project Definition version 2)
• Revised performance and user testing guides
