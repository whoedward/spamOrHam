Hi,
Sorry I was thinking others would respond to this.  But I had open this morning and I have close tonight, so I'd really prefer not to stay all day too (I also have a commitment this afternoon anyways).  Sorry!

    Hello,

    I know a lot of you have been looking for extra hours.  We have a busy day Saturday- I need someone from 8am-12pm and someone else from 12-4pm.  First two folks to respond to this email get the shift and my thanks!
