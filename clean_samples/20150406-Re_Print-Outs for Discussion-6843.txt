    Hi Ethan,

    Weeks 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are the only readings that require printing. You can bring in your eReader for the other weeks because we will be reading from books. Does that answer your question?

    Best,
    Joy

        Hi Joy,

        I'm one of the students in your Friday discussion section, and I just had a quick question about bringing the documents to class: would it be alright if I brought the documents in on my e-reader, that way I don't have to print them out?
        Printing is a little expensive, and my allotment as an engineering student only covers about 120 pages worth throughout the quarter.

        I understand if your policy doesn't allow this, I just figured that I should ask.

        Please let me know if you need any more information from me.

        Best,
