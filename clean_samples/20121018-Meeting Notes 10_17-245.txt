Hi NTS,

Here are the meeting notes from last night's meeting.

Announcements

Our training policy has changed this year, as Tim said in an earlier email. For new hires, we have a checklist that you should print/pull up when you're on shift. When you have a light shift, the returning tech should go through the checklist and make sure the new tech knows how to do the things on the checklist.

Here are our numbers, as well as Michael's in case anything comes up. We are always on call, as is Michael.

The supers are using a shared email, ntssupervisors@gmail.com, which sends a copy of the emails sent to that account to each of us. If you have any questions, you should send it there to get the fastest response.

Alex Yang - 224-600-0997
Fadhi Ali - 619-519-2506
Marina Williams - 224-355-6914
Tim White - 502-592-5402
Taha Kagadawala - 224-577-8767
Andrew Jung - 217-390-4555
Michael Mckean - 910-616-4888

We are counting meetings as shifts this year, so you if you miss a meeting without giving a valid reason beforehand, we will start giving out verbal warnings.

If you need your shift covered, please send out emails through the listserv. There earlier you send them out, the more likely someone will pick it up. If nobody can pick up your shift, you still must show up to the shift.

FALL SCHEDULING

Once again, here is the google doc for fall extracirriculars and classes. Please fill this out by Midnight Friday, 10/19. Otherwise, you will start to receive not so fun emails from us hounding you to fill it out.

We will have a new schedule out by the next meeting.

Speaking of the meeting next week, it will not be at our regular time, as we have nowhere to meet. As soon as we find a time to meet, we will inform you.

Missed Punches

For missed punches (any hours for which you were not able to clock in) please send them to michael.mckean@northwestern.edu and he will put them in for you.

For you those you who don't know, we work on 2 week schedules, but are paid on a 3 week schedule. This means that you should be getting a paycheck tomorrow for the hours you worked from 9/30 to 10/13, and you will receive a paycheck 11/2 for the hours you worked from 10/14 to 10/27.

Lastly, if we were hypothetically going to turn the back of the lab into a lounge, what would you want in it/what kind of theme would you want? Send suggestions to the supervisor email.

Alex
