Hi everybody :)

Tonight at 8PM we have an awesome fireside with Professor Roberts. He will be talking about the class he is teaching IN ISRC next quarter!

Right after, we will have elections at 8:30PM!! There will be tons of food so please come. :) 
You will have a chance to have ask candidates questions and meet your new (potential) exec board. 

Hannah will email you later tonight about the electronic voting process! There will be computers available for use tonight. 


P.S. if you still want to go to International Dinner and haven't sent me a recipe, I will accept them TODAY only. Any later, and you will have to purchase your own ingredients. 
P.P.S sign up for the talent show! :)
