Dear NTS:
         A new Norris Tech Services Manager has been hired! His name is Christopher Burpee, and he will be joining us from his position as Technical Director of Northeastern Illinois's Student Union. His arrival date is not set, but the search is over and we need to start a new transition phase. Feel free to contact the supers or Michael with any questions.

Sincerely,
