Hey guys,

For IFN on Saturday,we are going to watch an Italian tragicomedy called "Life is Beautiful (La vita Ã¨ bella)" http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1084398-life_is_beautiful/. This powerful and touching movie was both critical and financial success, winning three Academy Awards in 1998 for Best Actor, Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Foreign Language Film . Beside, it is one of the films that make me cry . 

So, bring the tissues and come enjoy the movie at 8PM in the basement !

Best,
Arkar
