Hey John,

Thanks for letting me know! And yeah I should be fine for the last hour of the event. Let me know if there's anything else.

See you soon,

Magan

    Hey Magan,

    So I spoke with Christina about this earlier, and I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to make it to the off-site event at 7 because I have to host the MGC carnival at the same time. Since it's just the last hour, you shouldn't have any problems without me being there. I am still planning on making it over at 8:30 to help you clean everything up however. In case my event runs long and I can't make it down in time, Christina said she or someone else from the meeting will go and help you take everything down.

    Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow.

    Thanks,
