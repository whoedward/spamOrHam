        Hey everyone,

        I've been feeling a little cruddy and I have a paper due on Tuesday, so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to cover my Monday shift 8AM-noon. It's a very easy shift with rarely anything to do. I'd be willing to pick up a shift later in the week in exchange.

        Best,
        Tim
