Hi ISRC!

One of our traditions at our formal, International Dinner, is to give out awards to residents. 

This year we are seeking nominations for the ISRC Spirit Award. This recognizes someone in our community who truly exemplifies what it means to have Pineapple Spirit. 

Please use this form to nominate someone. February 1st is the deadline.

ISRCLove,
Esteban
