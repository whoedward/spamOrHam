Tim and Juan,

You guys were on the Friday 2-4 today. When Max and I took over the next shift, we noticed a couple things.
1) Northwestern Room was not initialed, nor was it cleaned up, although the end time was set up 3:30 PM
2) Armadillo Room was set up but not initialed
3) Big Ten Room was set up but not initialed

We had to check all three rooms just to make sure they were good. We have been lax in enforcing the initialing of sheets before, but we won't be doing that this quarter. Initialing keeps everyone accountable and prevents us from wasting our time. Also, not cleaning up an event is not cool. I know you guys are probably not used to that and/or it was just a mistake, so just consider this a first warning of sorts.

If there's anything you need to let us know, just shoot an email back.
