Hello all,

I will hold a presentation about our paper "Minimizing Thermal Variation Across System Components" at 12pm this Wednesday in L440. The paper is to be published in IPDPS 2015. Abstract of the paper is attached at the end of this email. Lunch will be served.

I look forward to you joining!

Thanks,
Kaicheng

Abstract:
Thermal overheating is a serious concern in modern supercomputing
systems. In this paper, we first show that in a large-scale system,
physical attributes cause an uneven temperature distribution. We then
develop a model to characterize the thermal behavior of a complex
system using various machine learning methods. We propose to improve
application placement by incorporating thermal awareness into the
decision-making process. Specifically, our system predicts the thermal
condition of the system based on application mapping and uses these
predictions to mitigate thermal hotspots without any performance loss.
