Hey everyone,
Intramurals started today, we split our games (W in football and L in volleyball) but I think everyone had a ton of fun and got to know each other better as well which is the goal of intramurals
I think we'll only get better from here on out as well. Thanks for a really fun and great day you guys, it was really great to see all of y'all show up and play. Thank you all so much.

So, up next:
Football against CRC, meet at 11:30 in the main lounge (non-res's, y'all can either meet us there or come to the lounge- by the way, thank you so much ali for coming and dominating, you're the best). wear WHITE this time. I'll send out another e-mail as we get closer.
Volleyball against "Ski Bums", i dunno- meet at 2:30 in the main lounge and we can go over to Blom together and warm up.
Dodgeball: Would be Tuesday at 7:30 but we have a bye this week. See ya'll next Tuesday. Thanks.

Important: If you played today and would like to continue playing, or if you didn't play today but would like to play any of the sports, please send me your netIDs and specify which sport(s). This is very important so that I and Dominique (our captain for football) can add you all to the rosters. No sweat if you are no longer interested in playing!

One last note: I have heard talks of possible practices for any of the sports- if this is something that sounds interesting to you, let me know, and we can work out a time.

Thanks, isrclove
Paul Kim
