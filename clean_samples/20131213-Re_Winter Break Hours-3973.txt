Hey Will,

I put you in for all the shifts I can for next week.  It has them outlined in red because it doesn't like it, but I think it should be okay.  Please let us know if it still doesn't process that you're on shift.

    Dear Supervisors and Michael:
            I'm trying to sign up for every single winter break shift on shiftplanning, but it won't allow me to take some shifts because it states that I will go into 'daily overtime'. Seeing that the shifts sort of need to be covered can someone put me into those shifts?

    Thanks,
    Will Hyun
