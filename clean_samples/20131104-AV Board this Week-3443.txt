Hey supers!

So the AV Board this week is absolutely disgusting and I know the entire meeting will be spent fighting over who has to take these shifts.  Tim and Alex, I know you won't be there, but if you see anything you can take for even a couple hours I think that would be really helpful.  That goes for other supers too; anything we can get done before the meeting would be good.  Here's the meeting notes: just write your name on this Google Doc.

Also, Alex, could you make the schedule doc so that we supers can edit it?  Thanks.

Big Mike, bring your computer for Wednesday to cover shiftplanning; Ethan, if you could bring your laptop too and be the schedule editor, that would be great.  You were quicker at keeping up than I was.

Finally, these "permanent shift changes" that are still highlighted on the schedule: since there is just a few weeks left in the quarter, should we just not bother with them or what?

Thanks, guys!  May the odds be ever in our favor for Wednesday.
