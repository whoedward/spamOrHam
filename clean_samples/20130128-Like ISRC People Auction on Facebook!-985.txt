Hey everyone, 

I invited all of you to like the ISRC People Auction page on Facebook. However, in order for our auction to be successful, we need to people outside of ISRC to like our page. 

At Open Exec last night, I said that you can invite your friends to like the page. I was wrong. Only administrators can do that. However, you can share the page on your timeline. 

http://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction Click 'settings' in the right corner, and share. 

As an added incentive, if you share the page, you will be entered into a draw to win a prize. 

We'll be coming around in the next few days to make sure we have enough people signed up for the auction. To clarify, your only time commitment is whatever service you decide to auction off. 

Thanks! 

Hannah
