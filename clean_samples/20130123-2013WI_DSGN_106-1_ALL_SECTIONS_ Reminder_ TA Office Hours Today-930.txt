Hello all,

Just wanted to remind everyone that TA office hours are every Tuesday 5-7p, and Wednesday 3-4p. I'm here as a general resource: whether you have questions on graphics, the project, or any other part of the class. By my count I've gone through about 15 team-based design projects like DTC while at NU, and have picked up plenty of tips & tricks about the process.

I'll be sitting at a table on the 1st floor Ford lobby/atrium, and am happy to provide help however you might need it.

Best,
-Sam
