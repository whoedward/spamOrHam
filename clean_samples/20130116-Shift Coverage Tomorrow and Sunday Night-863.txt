Hey NTS,

I just found out yesterday that I'm going to D.C. to see the inauguration, but I leave tomorrow morning and will miss my shifts for the rest of this week. If some peeps could help fill in for me tomorrow (10 a.m. - 2 p.m.) and Sunday night (10 p.m. - midnight) I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks,
Matt
