Hey team!

The when2meet shows that Tuesdays from 5-6 works for everyone so let's meet then.

I reserved seminar room 3370 in 3N in the main library so we can meet there this week.


Also, please fill out the google doc with your phone number before the first meeting (I had to fix the sharing prefrences from the first time I sent it out):
