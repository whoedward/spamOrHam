Hey guys, if you have a shift this during the times mentioned in this email, make sure to email Michael by tomorrow morning so you can get paid. If you don't email him your hours, your pay will be delayed or not paid at all, so please make sure you give him your hours.

Thanks,

Alex

Good afternoon!

 

I just wanted to let you know that there is an early timesheet approval for the Martin Luther King Day holiday. This means that timesheets will be approved Friday morning. You will not be able to swipe on Friday after 1pm or on Saturday. Any hours that are swiped will NOT count towards your paycheck and will NOT be paid.

 

Please contact your supervisor if you have any questions. Supervisors will either enter your expected hours this week and make changes as needed, or enter your hours next week to be paid on your next paycheck.

 

Thanks,

Jenn
