Hey Guys,

Two things: First, at the time of this writing, there are only two office keys in Norris. This means that the third is floating around somewhere. Check your coat pockets, your pants pockets, and your hot pockets-it's somewhere. You aren't in trouble for having accidentally walked off with an NTS key-just make sure that it returns to NTS.

Second, I just found an office key on a key ring locked in the lock box in the office. Be sure that you are returning the keys to the info desk at the end of every closing shift. Better yet, it's not a bad idea to return them to the info desk as soon as you are finished with them on an opening shift.

Keep your eyes peeled,
