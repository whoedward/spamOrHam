    Hello ISRCers!

    We've got some seriously great XRC trips this quarter, and another set of tickets! This time, we'll be setting out to The Dining Room at Kendall College, a culinary arts school, for some fancy dining! I only have FOUR student tickets, so be quick (and tell me your course choices in the email)!


    The Event:
     

    The Dining Room at Kendall College, on Friday, May 9th from 5:05 to 8:30 PM -- Subsidized price:  $15

     

    Experience contemporary and exquisite dining on the Kendall College campus with extraordinary views of the city skyline. Culinary Arts students prepare and serve lunch and dinner five days a week. They also work behind a glass wall, so you can watch them cook!  It's so tasty, they're recommended in The MICHELIN Guide Chicago Restaurants 2013. They've also been recognized and highly rated by Zagat Survey 201 and received numerous accolades by respected Chicago food critics from the Sun Times and Check Please! The Dining Room at Kendall College is also committed to sustainability. Kendall is the first culinary school in the U.S. to receive Certified Green Restaurant status from the Green Restaurant Association, and the menu is seasonal, taking advantage of their very own herb and vegetable garden as well as fresh ingredients from the nearby Green City Market.  See the menu, and choose a first and second course before RSVPing.
