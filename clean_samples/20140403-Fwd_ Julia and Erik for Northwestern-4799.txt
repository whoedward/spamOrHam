Hi Everyone,

With the ASG Presidential elections coming up, I will be forwarding all emails about the candidates that I receive. (My apologies in advance in case there are a lot). 

Take a look to see who's running!

> Working with, and not for
> Northwestern already has a student government that works for its student body, but we look to a student government that works with the student body. We’re Julia and Erik, and we believe in a better Northwestern with you.

> Why you should vote for us
>
> We belong to many Northwestern communities -- from residential colleges and sports teams, to student groups and freshmen orientation programs. Over the past three years, these relationships have created unforgettable experiences and lasting memories.
>
> But it hasn’t always been fun. We know there are obstacles that keep all of us from fully enjoying our Northwestern Experience. We want to change that -- and that’s exactly why we’re running.
>
> We’ve already worked to improve Norris, planned events for thousands of students, and lobbied for improved programming in residences all over campus. With each initiative, we engaged and empowered students from various communities to take action. After all, as students it is our responsibility to enact change, and when we work together amazing things can happen.
>
> That’s how we’ll lead ASG. We’ll lead it with you -- not for you. Because doing work for people means excluding them from it, and we don’t believe in that. Take a look at our platform to learn more about what we hope to accomplish and how we’ll do it with you.
