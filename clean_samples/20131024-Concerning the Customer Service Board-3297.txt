NTS,

There have been incidences of people writing on the customer service board (the one by the punch-in clock). Someone put in a lot of time and effort making it, so scribbling over it is pretty disrespectful. While I trust you all already know this, this is a reminder: do not vandalize the board.

From,
Michael Wang
