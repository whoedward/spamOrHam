Hey Team -

We were supposed to meet today from 5-8 but it looks like a lot of people were busy.  Let's meet on Sunday at 2 and work until 5 or 6.  That's a long time but we still have a lot to get done before the presentation.  Also let's plan on meeting on Monday and Tuesday from 4-7 (if we need both days.)  Please respond if you can make Sunday as well as Monday and Tuesday.  As we near the deadline, it's important that everyone come to the meetings.

Enjoy dillo day,

Jeremy
