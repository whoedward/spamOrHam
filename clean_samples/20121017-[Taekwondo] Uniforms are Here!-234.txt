Hello everyone,

This is just a friendly reminder to bring dues and uniform money if you ordered one to practice tonight. The uniforms are 20 dollars each, and dues are 35 dollars. The uniforms arrived today, so that's one more thing to look forward to at practice. If you still haven't ordered a uniform and you don't own one but would like to order one, please send me an email. If enough people are still interested in ordering uniforms, we can make another set of orders for 20 dollars each. Otherwise, we'll make another big order for uniforms in Winter Quarter.

And, as a special bonus free of charge, here's how to count to ten in Korean:

1 - "hana"                             하나
2 - "dool"                              둘
3 - "set"                                셋 
4 - "net"                                냇 
5 - "da sut"                           다섯
6 - "yu sut"                           여섯
7 - "il gop"  (long o sound)   일곱
8 - "yu dul"                           여덟
9 - "ah hop" (long o sound) 아홉
10 - "yul"                              열

Everyone needs to know how to count to ten in Korean. You don't need to know how to write it or read it. I just put that there for kicks. We have belt tests at the end of every quarter, and if you are testing (hopefully that's everyone not a black belt), you will be expected to be able to count to ten in Korean.

See you all at practice!

El Presidente,
Ji-hoon
