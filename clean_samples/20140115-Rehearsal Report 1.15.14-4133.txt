Rehearsal Notes:

    We had a good day of working and trying some new stuff with Act I. We’ll be doing the same tomorrow with Act II, so that we can go into our run-through on Saturday refreshed and fully prepared.
    Once we do our run-through—so, starting next week—we’ll be doing some more playing with the dialogue, but also taking some time to work in technical elements. We’d like to do some preparatory blood (water?) runs before we get to Shanley. It would also be great if we could have some rehearsal props (specifics to be discussed) for next week. All of this can be discussed more at the prod meeting on Sunday—just a heads up!
