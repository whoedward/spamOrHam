Hey ISRCers!

In only 3 days, the election for the new exec board will be here! So we have something special planned for this Sunday. At 6pm, we'll be hosting a pre-election game night in the main lounge leading up to the election. So come play some board games, construct a huge jigsaw puzzle, and more!

See you all there,
Thomas
