Hey Angela,

Sorry about the late response. Either one of those is perfectly fine.

    Hey! I'm so sorry I won't be able to make the group training session this saturday:( I have a leadership conference  scheduled from 9-3 that day. Would it be ok if I do the training on the coming monday or tuesday with Ethan or Tim while I'm on shift? Thanks so much!

    Best,
    Angela
