Hey Alex,

I'm emailing because you missed last night's meeting and did not email an excuse to the Supers ahead of time. Just keep in mind that the meetings are mandatory, and that missing one counts as a missed shift. If you have any questions, feel free to email me or NTSsupervisors@gmail.com.

Regards,
