NORRIS TIME CAPSULE
As Norris student employees, what will you want to remember in 40 years? 

We're celebrating Norris' 40th birthday with a Time Capsule, and we want to include YOUR unique Northwestern memories! 

Student Affairs Marketing (3rd floor of Norris) is collecting items NOW THROUGH FRIDAY, MAY 17 at 12pm for a time capsule to be opened in 40 years. All items that could fit in a shoebox will be considered except:
- Food
- T-shirts
- Newspapers
- Anything dangerous, illegal or semi-legal

The Norris Time Capsule will be stored in University Archives.
