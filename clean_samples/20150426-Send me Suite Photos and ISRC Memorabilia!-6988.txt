Hey you photogenic people!

I'm planning to send stuff to the Northwestern University Archives so that we can be immortalized for as long as NU exists and future ISRC residents 100+ years from now can go look at us and marvel at our style or hairdos or ponder time or something. 

I'd like each suite to take a group photo (or more) doing whatever you do, and email those to me. 

Also, hit me up with any memorabilia (programs, other photos, etc.) you think should also be go down in the annals of NU history.

These photos will also potentially be spicing up the bulletin boards in our section of Hinman.

Kathleen
