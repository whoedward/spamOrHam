Hi,
I was wondering if it would be possible to meet with either of you today about taking some time off/leaving my position at Norris Tech Staff. This quarter is shaping out to be an incredibly difficult one to the point where failing a class is a serious possibility. Although I value my position as a memeber of NTS, my grades are an absolute priority. I also don't think it's very fair of me to commit to shifts to which I cannot give my full attention and effort.

Please advise as to what my next step should be.

Best regards,
Daniela V DeLeon
