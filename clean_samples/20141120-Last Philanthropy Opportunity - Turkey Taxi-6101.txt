Hello ISRCers!

This is your last philanthropy opportunity of the quarter! On Saturday morning, RCB will be assembling and decorating Turkey Taxi boxes to deliver to families. This will occur in University Hall room 418 from 11-1. Any of you can sign up, but there is a limited amount of space in the room, so sign up quickly to ensure that you are able to participate! Here is a link to the sign ups.

Also, I need all of your items to go in the ISRC Turkey Taxi box by tonight! If your suite does not give me the item, each member will lose a philanthropy point. Double check the link below to remember what your suite is in charge of getting.

ISRClove, 

Ellen
