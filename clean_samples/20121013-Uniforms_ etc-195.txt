Hello,

Firstly, I apologize for the late response to the email regarding uniforms. I am interested in a uniform, and would like one of a size of either 4 or 5. I say either because I am 5' 8" and about 170-175 pounds (a.k.a., right at the threshold). I would prefer a size 4, unless you think that it would be too restrictive. Your opinion is respected here.

On another note, a friend of mine wishes to be added to the mailing list. Her email is: madelinemcfee2016@u.northwestern.edu. Please add her. As well, she should be sending you an email regarding her uniform size shortly. If there is anything else that you need, please feel free to mention it.

Thanks,
Ethan
