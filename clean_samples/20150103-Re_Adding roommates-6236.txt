Hi Jennifer,

Sorry about any confusion this might have caused. Mike and I realized a little after sending that that we won't be moving out after all. Because of this, we're good to go on any questions.

Again, sorry for the confusion. Thanks for your time.

    Hello Ethan,

     

    Mary forwarded me your email.  She is not in the office today.

     

    You live in a 2 bedroom apartment.  Only 2 people can live in a two bedroom apartment.  Are you and your roommate leaving?  If so, you will have to sublet to the other two people.  That means they have to apply and get approved and if they are approved, you and your roommate will have to move out.

     

    We do not give keys to people who are not approved the apartment.

     

    Let me know if you and your roommate are moving.  If so, I can let you know about the subletting process.

     

    Thanks
