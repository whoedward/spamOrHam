Hey, guys! 


So as some of you guys already know we are officially your new officers for the upcoming year, and we are ecstatic! For those of you guys who may not know us too well, I, Davin, am currently a sophomore undergraduate studying Industrial Engineering with an intense love for cute animal videos. I, Natalie, am currently a freshman majoring in Biomedical Engineering who hates working out...(am I allowed to say this..?). And finally I, Joanna, am currently a sophomore Cognitive Sciences major, Psychology minor who probably won't be seeing you all too much in the fall because of marching band. All of us are really looking forward to learning Tae Kwon Do and having a blast together with you guys. We hope to really make this club exciting as well as rewarding for everyone, and we promise (and promised) to do our best in achieving this goal. If there ever is any concern, need, want, demand, suggestion, et cetera, please let us know and we will give it our utmost attention and consideration. With all that said, let’s make it a good one next year.


Love y’all,

Davin, Natalie, and Joanna
