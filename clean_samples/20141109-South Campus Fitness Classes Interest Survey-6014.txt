Hi south campus residents! 

Associated Student Government (ASG) is investigating the possibility of bringing group fitness and recreation classes to south campus. Please fill out this brief survey to help us gauge student interest and class preference:http://tinyurl.com/southcampusfitness. The survey is very short and your responses will assist us in making the case for having these classes on south campus. Thank you for your help!
