 Hey ISRCers, IFN this week will be a German comedy film called "Good Bye, Lenin!" -- a coming-of-age adventure that blends the fall of Communism in East Germany with the salient emotions of a family love. Released in 2003, the film was well-received and won various awards, including Deustcher Filmpreis, a German equivalent of the Academy Award.  Come enjoy this great movie on Friday 8PM in the basement and get academic points !

Best,
Arkar
