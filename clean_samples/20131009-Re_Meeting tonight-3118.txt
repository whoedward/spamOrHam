Thanks for letting us know!  We'll do our best to get that Friday shift off your hands.

    Hey guys,

    We have a Baja meeting tonight so I won't be able to make the meeting. We're looking to move the time though so I'll be there next week.

    As always, someone can take my Friday shift. :)

    -Will
