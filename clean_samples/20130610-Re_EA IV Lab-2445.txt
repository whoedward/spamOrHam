Since D is constant, if I plot the sum of the square roots of the amplitudes squared with respect to omega, I get the first attached graph.
My confusion stems from the fact that this does not look correct, nor does it look like the graphs that I have seen from my peers.

    Wait, using the undetermined coefficients method, the components of the D vector are the amplitudes of the particular solution. Because of the damping, you expect that the homogenous solution decays to zero over time, and so the particular solution is in fact the steady-state solution.

    So once you have the D vector, you have the steady-state amplitudes, and there's no need to solve anything with ode45 or use the Green's theorem method.

Remember that for a cosine you either guess a particular solution that includes sin and cos, matching up terms after you substitute, or you replace cos(w t) with e^(i w t ), use e^(i w t) in the particular solution and take real part of the solution at the end.
