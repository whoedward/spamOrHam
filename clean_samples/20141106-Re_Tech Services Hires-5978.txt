Thanks so much, Jenn!

Also, in the future, when employees are hired, could you send us a notification via email? It would help a lot in getting people started.

Thanks again for all of your help!

    Hi Jenn,

     

    The Tech Supers were wondering if it would be possible for you to let us know when our new hires get their paperwork in/processed so that we can better keep track of our techs. Just a quick "heads up," is all.

     

    If it's too much trouble, don't sweat it! We know that you're busy.

     

    Best,

     

    Ethan (and all of the techs)
