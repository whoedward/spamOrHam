Hi Anne,

I just spoke with payroll in my building. The form has been faxed.

Best,

    Ethan,

    You have not submitted your Work-Study Authorization Form for the 2014-2015 academic year.  We need a record of where you are working each year even if you had this job last year.

    Please complete the form with your supervisor and fax, scan or drop it off to our office, 1801 Hinman Ave, 2nd floor. 

    Here is the link to the form:  http://undergradaid.northwestern.edu/work-study/pdf/AuthForm1415.pdf

    Thank you,

    Anne Horne
