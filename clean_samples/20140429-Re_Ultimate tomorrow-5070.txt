Hi all,
Do not come to ultimate. We are disqualified.

Enjoy your evening,
Paul Kim

    Hi all,
    As far as I'm concerned, we are still playing ultimate today. Please meet in the lobby at 4:30 if you want to participate, and please wear white. I'll let you know if weather cancels.

    Thank you,
    Paul Kim
