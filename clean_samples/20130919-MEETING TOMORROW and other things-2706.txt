Greetings, NTS!

A reminder from an email that Bobby sent out a couple weeks ago: MANDATORY NTS MEETING is TOMORROW (9/20) night at 7 pm at Norris.  Location is still TBD, but we will let you know.  If you cannot make it, you must send in your [valid] excuse to ntssupervisors@gmail.com. 

Also, there is still one more Ryan event tomorrow night that needs coverage (you'd miss the meeting).  It is only from 5-8:45 and is just the Alcohol ENU for the new Wildcats.  Pretty basic stuff and who doesn't love learning about alcohol safety?

See you guys tomorrow night!
Christina
