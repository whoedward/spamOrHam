> And you may find yourself sitting in Leverone Auditorium from 3-5 PM on Friday, December 13 taking your micro final.  And you may say to yourself, “Well, how do I work this?

> About 16-20 questions.  Of these, 10-14 will be multiple choice or fill in the blank questions.  Of the others, one will be from first midterm material and one from second midterm material. These two will cover central themes.  You know…or should.  Don’t ask.  Time constraint shouldn’t be an issue.

> When I will finish tweaking the exam, I will say, “This exam is fly.” In other words, aesthetically pleasing.  In other words, the bomb diggity.
>
> No need for gas tax with rebate questions.  No need for charity questions.  No need for kidney questions.  No need for questions on the real world examples from the text or on the kidney readings.
>
> Roughly 45% of the points accounted for by new material.  The other 55% is roughly equally split between fair-game material for the 1st and 2nd midterm.  New Material for Final Exam posted in Documents section.  Notified if major changes.

> I’ll be available to answer questions on anything.  The TAs will be available to answer questions on the problem sets or practice exam questions.  The schedule of hours for this week is on Blackboard.   The schedule for next week will be posted toward the end of this week.
