Hi everyone,
 
I'm sorry I never sent out a doodle poll for donuts; Leena said she had enough people to help her sell.  However, it's time for a doodle poll for canning this Sunday, May 5, in downtown Evanston!  Leena suggested that we go near the movie theatre, but we can basically go anywhere we want.  The poll has half-hour shifts from 12-2:30pm, and it would be great if we had at least two people signed up per shift.  I know that asking people for money can sometimes suck, but it's the North Shore! :) And in case you don't read the lovely description of my poll, in the words of our illustrious president Nathan Lamp, if you don't support the fight against cancer, THEN YOU LIKE CANCER!  So please help us out, and you definitely don't have to be on the ISRC Relay for Life team to go canning.  Drag a friend with you to make it less painful. :)  Here's the link: http://www.doodle.com/nvyrfmesrmitwsi2
 
And most importantly, THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has already joined our team.  You guys are awesome. :)  I believe we have 10 people now!  But we still need more.  Please join, and if you're worried about raising money, we will help you out.  Eric and I are thinking of doing a movie marathon fundraiser type thing - getting a room in Harris or Fisk and showing a bunch of movies one night next weekend (Friday the 10th or Saturday the 11th, maybe) and getting people to pay a couple of dollars to drop by after voting for the movies we'll show, and perhaps there will be food.  Perhaps.  More details to come. :)
 
Thanks,
Ayla
