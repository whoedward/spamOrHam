Hi ISRC,

RCB formal tickets are still on sale, but we're starting to reach our cap. If you want to buy a ticket, I have placed a bunch of envelopes on my door. 

Take an envelope, write your name and room number on it, put in the $15, and slide it under my door. I am in room 223, which is 2-red. (One Direction is on my door, so it should be easy to find). 

Ticket sales will officially end on Oct. 31st. Buy your ticket now!!

ISRCLove,
Esteban
