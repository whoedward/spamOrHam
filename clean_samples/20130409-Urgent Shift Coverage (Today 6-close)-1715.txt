Good morning everyone,

Apparently my flight back to Chicago got delayed a few hours and it looks like I'll be missing at least the first two hours of my shift (6-8pm). Can anyone help me out? If someone can pick up 6-8:30 or 6-9 that would be even better just to be on the safe side. Let me know! Thanks!

-Fadhi
