Hi NUBJJ!

So... I'm in Brazil right now studying abroad and I decided to do jiu-jitsu while I'm here.  Today was my first class and even though I've never done it with a gi (they call it a "kimono" lol) before everyone was really impressed!  I even submitted this girl who was a yellow belt!  

Anyways, I just wanted to say that I hope everything is well with the jiu-jitsu club and I LOVE YOU ALL!  GO NUBJJ!

Abra√ßos,
Sydney

            Hello grappling enthusiasts,

    Welcome back to those of you that are back already and safe travels back to those of you who aren't!
    The fall activity fair is this Sunday the 22nd from 12-5:30. This is the main time that we promote our club and get new members. If any of you can help out, that would be great. If you're interested let me know.

    remember, position before position before submission!

    Jacob
