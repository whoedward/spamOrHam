Hey guys,

Probably a record on needed shifts covered so early after taking a shift, but I'm headed home for this weekend through next weekend, so I need the Saturday 2pm-6pm covered this Satrurday the 15th and next Saturday the 22nd.

Also, is this the best way to ask for coverage or is there a list of just the summer techs that I should use?

Thanks,

Will
