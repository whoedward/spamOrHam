Hello everyone,

Jacob is out of town this weekend so I will be stepping in the do this weeks bjj class.  It will be sunday from 11 to 1 just like last week, and we will be going over some really cool techniques.

We will start off with a review from last week so everyone can remember what they learned the week before, but we will also be going over some new moves including the rear naked choke and the kimura which are 2 of the simplest but most effective attacks in jui jitsu.

Here are some short videos on each move for those of you that are interested.

Rear Naked Choke:

Kimura from Gaurd:

I also would encourage people to start rolling tomorrow at the end of class, which is bjj's version of sparring.  For those that are new to jui jitsu I will walk you through the process and probably have you watch some of the more experienced guys roll first.

See you tomorrow,
Sean
