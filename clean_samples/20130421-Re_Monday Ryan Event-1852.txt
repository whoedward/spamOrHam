We still need to cover the event in its entirety on the sheet. Appreciate your input, but I'd still love to get this covered!

    I can't take the event, but I wanted you to know that the event is from 6-7 PM.  It usually keeps to that time frame fairly well (if it even goes to 7:15 people get annoyed).

        Hey all,

        I just remembered that I was supposed to participate in my fraternities IM event, so can someone take the monday ryan from 4-8? 4-6 could work too, since the event goes from 5-6 but I'm not sure if it will end on time. 

        Thanks!

        Andrew
