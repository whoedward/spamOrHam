Hi Everyone,

I am in the middle of a crazy week of papers and midterms, and I would really like some extra time to work on things this afternoon. Would anyone like to take my 2pm-4pm today? If no one can, it's fine, I can work it, I would just rather not because I have a lot of stuff that has to get done. Thanks!
