Dear Priority Number Registrant:

Your 2013-2014 housing priority number is available online. You may view your priority number by logging into https://rms.housing.northwestern.edu/.

Please keep a record of your priority number for future reference. Priority numbers can and will be verified during the assignment process. Priority numbers are non-transferable.

Students will be selecting their rooms for the 2013-14 school year online. It will be possible to search for available rooms. Any available room will be displayed for room selection. Rooms not visible are either assigned or held for entering students.

Controlling priority numbers wishing to pull in roommates/suitemates will need the NetIDs and roommating passwords (not University NetID passwords!) for those individuals to be pulled in. You previously received an email informing you that passwords could be created by signing into the Student Web Self-Assignment beginning now. Those with controlling priority numbers must have these passwords in order to pull anyone into his/her roommate/suitemate group.

For more information, please read the application procedure located at: http://www.northwestern.edu/living/assignments/application/returning/returning-student-2013.html
