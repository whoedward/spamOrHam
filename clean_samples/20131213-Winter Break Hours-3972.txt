Dear Supervisors and Michael:
        I'm trying to sign up for every single winter break shift on shiftplanning, but it won't allow me to take some shifts because it states that I will go into 'daily overtime'. Seeing that the shifts sort of need to be covered can someone put me into those shifts?

Thanks,
Will Hyun
