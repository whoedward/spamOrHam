The poll is conducted every year by the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee to get a sense of what students think would improve the undergraduate experience at Northwestern. The data collected will be used to prepare a report to the president, provost and other senior administrators during winter quarter.

Past accomplishments of the UBPC include wireless internet in the dorms and lecture halls, President's convocation in SPAC, the Saturday shuttle to Chicago, increased funding for undergraduate research grants, improvements to the Norris ground floor and
moving A&O Blowout to Welsh-Ryan arena.
