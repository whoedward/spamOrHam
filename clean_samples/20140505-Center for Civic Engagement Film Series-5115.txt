    After Tiller is a 2013 documentary film that follows the only four remaining doctors in the United States who openly perform late-term abortions. The title refers to George Tiller, a doctor who performed abortions and was murdered in 2009. Praised for "giving voice not only to the doctors, but to...the women themselves," After Tiller provides an important look at a controversial topic.
