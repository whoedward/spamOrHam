This is completely irrelevant, but would any of you be available this weekend to help me loft a bed?

My roommate moved out into a single in Plex this week and I want to loft his bed for the extra space.

If it's any extra inducement there'll probably be enough room afterwards to make it into a DTC meeting space if that sounds like a good idea.
