Hello Professor Herrick,

Team Four (section one) here. We are emailing you in regards to the essay meeting time and date. According to the syllabus, our essay conference is this upcoming Tuesday (2/12/13). However, according to the syllabus the following Thursday (2/14/13) is a day on which Team Four should prepare for our essay conference. We will be preparing for our conference this Tuesday regardless, but would like some clarity on the issue. Thank you for your time.

Best,
Team Four
