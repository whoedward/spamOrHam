I don't think I can, sorry. However, I've yet to see what my usual work schedule is, so if it works out I'll drive down there and join you. I just won't know until shortly before the meet-up.

        A pox on thee and thy kin, Eric of House Morales! (Damn these stupid Game of Thrones books. At least I'm caught up to the TV show now, so that's good, I guess.)

        Thoughts from anyone else? I'm open to choosing another weekend if a bunch of people can't do the last weekend of July, but we should probably figure something out soon if this is ever going to happen.

            No can do guys. My family is going to come into town, and I haven't seen them in 6 months, so I probably will not be attending! Have fun though.

                I would agree, Cincinnati seems like a pretty solid meeting place.

                Any thoughts on this, guys? If we're going to do it the final weekend of July, we probably want to get it nailed down pretty soon here.

                    I think Cincinnati will work really well. Between my house and Matt's apartment, we'll definitely have room for everyone to sleep. That last weekend of July should work I think. How about for everyone else?

                        So, from what people have said so far, it sounds as though the best weekends to go with would be the final two weekends of July, the 19th-20th and the 26th-27th. The first of those two is rather non-ideal for me, but I could probably swing it if that's what we chose. Final weekend of July works great, though. What do you guys think?

                        Also, any additional thoughts on a location?

                                    The idea of a summer meetup has been thrown around, but let's see if we have some actual interest. So respond with your level of commitment, location preferences, and ideal dates. Also if there is anyone else who I missed and you think would be interested let me know.

                                    Side note: I found all our locations in latitude and longitude and averaged them to find the "best" place to meet up. And it is ... LIGONIER, INDIANA! (41.444, -85.553)

                                    Hope your summers are off to a good start,
                                    Jonas


                                I'll add to the resounding chorus of "weekend-only", as I've got a full-time job, but I appear to be available pretty much any weekend.
