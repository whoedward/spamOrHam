Hey everyone,

If you are planning on living in ISRC again next year, please disregard most of the e-mail you just received from Undergraduate Housing. You may need to sign a housing contract from them, but you DEFINITELY DO NOT NEED a priority number. We have our points system for that, and room selection will be a different process as well. I will be sending out an e-mail with full details on our housing process next Monday. Now is the time to seriously think about whether or not you wish to stay in ISRC next year.

Thanks,
Thomas
