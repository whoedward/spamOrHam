Hi, guys,

For those who are new to Tae Kwon Do and don't have a uniform and would like one, it would be great if you guys could email either me or Natalie that you're interested. When doing so, please let us know your height. We will be getting uniforms through BTMA with the help of Master Kallo. These uniforms shouldn't cost more than $20-25, but I will update you guys on that as soon as I can. These uniforms do not have the black stripes on top, so it really is designed for the color belts.

Secondly, for those of us who plan on consistently participating in our sparring sessions, Master Kallo is kindly asking us to acquire at the very least some form of forearm and shin guards. This is mainly for our protection and to minimize the chance of injuries. Eric sent out an email a few weeks ago with links to purchasing sparring gear online. You may use those links or find some other suitable means. We recommend the full sparring gear, but Master Kallo would like for us to at least have forearm and shin guards during sparring days.

If you have any questions (especially with regards to sparring gear), please don't hesitate to email me or any of the other officers.

Thanks, guys!

-Davin
