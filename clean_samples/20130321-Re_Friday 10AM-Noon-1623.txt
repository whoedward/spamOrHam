    Hey,

    It's the spring break shift, which I'm on so you don't have to worry. Good luck!

        Hello everyone! I have my last final Friday afternoon, and this is an important one because I really need to do well on it to salvage my grade.  Is anyone willing to pick up this shift from me? Thanks!
