Hello,

In recitation this morning, a few of you asked me how to complete 6d in the homework - the obvious method seemed to require excessive computation. You are correct that it is a lot of work - for that reason you may compute the necessary calculations using Maple / Mathematica / Wolfram Alpha.

Also note that to obtain the semilog plot described in in part 6a, it will be necessary to take the absolute value of the error.

Please email me your completed code (newton, halley, and taylor2). I will accept printed or digital versions of the required figure for part 6c and the result of part 6d.

If you need clarification on any of this, please let me know.

Best,
Haley
