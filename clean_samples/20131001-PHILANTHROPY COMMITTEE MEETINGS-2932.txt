Hello, lovely ISRCers!

The first PHILANTHROPY COMMITTEE MEETING is this Thursday at 5 in the main lounge. It is open to all ISRCers who want to come, not just the 8 people who have already talked to me about their interest in joining the committee. The meeting should last only 10-20 minutes, and I recommend it for anyone considering doing DM for the first time. We're already going to start talking about fundraising for DM! Plus, you get half a philanthropy point for attending the meeting. Thanks so much, and I hope to see some of you this Thursday at 5!!!!!

ISRClove,
Ayla
