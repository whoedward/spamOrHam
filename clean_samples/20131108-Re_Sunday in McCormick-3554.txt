    Hey Supers,

    We have a pretty big set up in McCormick on Sunday.  Iâ€™m going to need one or two of you to stop by and make sure Max and William are not in over their heads. We will be using the Allen and Heath mixer out to the new Mackie speakers.  There will be 3 microphones and one DI box.  There will also be a stage monitor (EON).  So you will need to use the SNAKE. 

    I have given Eric Yang (Client) permission to help set up and run the show.  He knows what he is doing.

     

    Please let me know if you have any questions.
