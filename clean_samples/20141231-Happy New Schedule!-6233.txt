A great new way to start the year is with the NTS Winter Quarter Shift Schedule! Link is above.

Let's kick off 2015 by verifying your Winter Quarter schedule and making sure you will be able to work those shifts!

If you have any questions about your shifts, or if I made a mistake against your availability, let me know! Sent me a separate email at juwonhyun2016@u.northwestern.edu

A few notes about the schedule:

How I made the schedule - 
-I like all of you, and I tried very hard to try and give you your preferred shifts, and to give you subsequent shifts instead of scattered ones. Every assigned shift has a specific reason for its assignment, and I tried extremely hard to make sure that everyone GOT shifts, and that you got close to the amount of hours you wanted, and that all shifts got covered in the most convenient distribution for everyone possible. 
If you have any questions regarding scheduling, email me at juwonhyun2016@u.northwestern.edu

-Three people did not fill out their availability, and those three will need to ask for shifts on our first meeting of Winter Quarter.

-For the first time in the past two years, we are actually fully staffed. And by that I mean that no one has more than 10 scheduled hours and most of you have 8. For those that requested more than that, you can always pick those hours up with continuing ed (8:30-3:30 Tues/Thurs), out of house, or those blessed rotations. This also helps to make sure that we don't have employees running out of work study spring quarter.

-We still need continuing education shifts covered. The hours are from 8:30-3:30 Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know if you would like all or a part of those shifts.

-These shifts will be available on shiftplanning sometime soon. The google doc is for reference purposes only. 

-You'll be able to trade shifts/give them away at our first meeting, on January 7th, 2015, at 7pm!

-Shout out to Brett Warner for his willingness to take 4 opens. 

Sincerely,
Will Hyun
