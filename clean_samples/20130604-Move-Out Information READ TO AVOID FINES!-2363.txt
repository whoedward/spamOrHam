Hey J1F Residents,

Instead of a lengthy email from me about how to properly move out of your residence hall room, Residential Services created this Move-Out Guide for your reference (link below and attached as a PDF).  It covers all needed info EXCEPT how to sign up for a checkout appointment in J1F (checkout signups vary by residential area).  That info is below.  The highlights from the Move-Out Guide and J1F checkout signup will also be posted on many bulletin boards in the J1F area, so check around your halls and ask your CA if you have questions.  "I didn't know" won't get you out of fines after checkout, so please read the enclosed information carefully and ask your CA questions as soon as possible.

Move-Out Guide:  http://issuu.com/nuresidentialservices/docs/move-out-guide-2013.

Thanks!
Amanda


How to sign up for a J1F Checkout Appointment:

1.  Complete this Google Form AT LEAST 24 hours prior to your departure.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11NINVgPBFlPu7D8qO_oE9VutalNrFAFHVKWVJLInSXk/viewform

2.  Contact your CA if you have questions or need an exception to the appointment windows (you are planning to leave before Friday, June 7th or between 10pm-8am on any given day; CAs will happily check you out prior to June 7th, but exceptions for late-night departures are granted only in cases of demonstrated need like 3am flights).  PLAN ACCORDINGLY.
