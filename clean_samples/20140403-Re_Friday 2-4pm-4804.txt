        Hi all,

        I released the Friday 2-4pm shift on ShiftPlanning Wednesday, but I haven't heard anything yet.  Would it be possible for somebody to cover it? 

        I'd like to meet with one of my advisors, and he's only available in this time-slot.  You'd be doing me a big favor!

        Thanks,
        Ryan
