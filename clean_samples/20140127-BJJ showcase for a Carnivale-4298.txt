Hi everyone,

I just received an email that the Northwestern World Cup (I think it is a soccer tournament between different student groups), is hosting a Carnivale in honor of the Brazilian theme of this year's tournament.

They have asked us if we would be willing to do a BJJ showcase at the Carnivale. It is currently scheduled for Feb. 27th, 7-11pm in Norris.

This would be a really awesome way to get our club some publicity and to show some sweet BJJ moves. Let me know if you are interested in participating!
