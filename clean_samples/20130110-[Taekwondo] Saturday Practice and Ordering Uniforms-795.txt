Hey everyone,

Just so that everyone knows, we will be having practice this Saturday at Blomquist from 12 to 2.

And now that that's out of the way, we'll also be ordering uniforms again very soon. Like last quarter, we're going to try to order all the uniforms together to save costs. Expect the price to be somewhere between 20 and 25 dollars for the uniform. If you are interested in ordering a uniform, please reply to this email with your size (small, medium, or large). I will put in the order on Monday night so you have until then to place the order (you can order a uniform later, too, but the price will be higher). These are only for the regular uniforms. If you are a black belt and want a fancy black belt uniform for 20 to 25 dollars... lolololololololololol

K. See you all Saturday.

Ji-hoon
