Hi everyone,

I hope your winter breaks were restful, restorative, rejuvenating, fun and totally preparatory for doing BJJ this quarter!

Unfortunately, I'm a bit sick right now, so we won't be having practice this Sunday. Practice will start on Sunday Jan. 19th.

Muay thai may still be happening, stay tuned for an email about that.

peace,
Jacob
