Okay. I guess it was his laptop then. I did try to go to settings and change it to have the sound come out of an external device but the laptop couldn't detect it. So I thought it might be the audio system but I guess not.

Thank you

However, with that said I do not expect anyone but the owner of the laptop to know what their settings are.  Our laptops work correctly and are set up to connect audio/video via HDMI.   So if the clients laptop doesn’t function correctly you can offer them one of ours.
