Hi everyone,

Here are the notes from last night's meeting

Announcements:

There were permanent changes made to the schedule - please check shiftplanning and make sure you know all the shifts you are assigned to.

Tier 2 training, which is basically the McCormick system, needs to be done by February 15th. There was a new system installed in McCormick over the break, so everyone needs to be retrained on it.

Make sure you are initialing both sets of sheets after every setup/teardown. If the other person on shift sets up or tears down the event, you need to initial on your sheets as well. At the end of the day, it is the closing shift's responsibility to make sure both sets of sheets get back into the cubby.


Shift Coverages:

Tim Fri 1/17 2-4pm ----> Max
Max 1/18 Sat 12-6pm -----> Ethan
Tim Mon 1/20 10am-12pm -----> Alex
Will Wed 12-2pm ----> Kara

Thanks,
