Yo supes,

Yesterday I filled out the office hours on ShiftPlanning for all the supes. Everyone should take a look and make sure yours is correct. I think we should send an email out about office hours and then discuss it futher during the meeting on Wednesday.

Also, as a side note, I think we should label the cabinets on the second floor with the contents (so people stop taking the VGAs in the Rock Room down to the lab, for example). Let me know what you think.
