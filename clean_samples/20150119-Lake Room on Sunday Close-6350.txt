Ed and Chen - the Lake Room had its screen down with the input pad and a mac adapter out today when I checked it this afternoon.  There were no events today in that room, so I'm guessing it got left out from last night.  Fortunately, the projector itself was turned off, but we might not have been so lucky.  Just remember to sweep every single meeting room when you close for the night.
