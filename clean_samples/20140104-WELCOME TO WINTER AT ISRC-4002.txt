Hey people!

Welcome to winter quarter at ISRC! We have so much awesome prepared for this quarter, so that's why we're having a MANDATORY OPEN EXEC on 1/12 at 8:30pm. FOOD WILL BE THERE TO BE CONSUMED. We have very important things to tell you (HINT: our annual formal for instance...).
Also, I will finally complete the ISRC photo roster which will be available for all of you and the fellows (they really want to get to know you!). So for the 20 or so people who didn't get their picture taken by me from Wildcat Welcome, I'll be finding you throughout the week to take your picture.
That's all for now. And don't worry, this is the last quarter you'll have to put up with my e-mails, so cherish them while you can! ;D
Oh, and here is the link to this quarter's points list (this will also be on the Facebook page): https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av4OS4eBjonVdEVDSlNXM2hXWVpMY1N5YXRYcENOZ0E&usp=sharing

Cheers,
