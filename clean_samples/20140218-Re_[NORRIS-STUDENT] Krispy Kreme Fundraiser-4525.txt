    Hey Everyone,
     
    The club basketball team is hosting a Krispy Kreme Fundraiser to try to raise some money for us to make it to a national tournament.
     
    If you know that would like some donuts, pre-orders are $7/dozen.
    If you're not sure, but might, orders the day-of are $8/dozen.
    If you would like a few (but not a dozen), individual donuts are $1 each.
     
    Pick-up will be on March 7th, 2014 somewhere on campus.
     
    Please let me know if you are/might be interested in ordering Krispy Kreme donuts (aka doughnuts, if you prefer). Please see the attached flyer for pricing and pickup information.
     
    Thanks for your help!
     
    Enjoy,
    Harry
