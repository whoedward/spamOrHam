Hey guys!

Have you ever noticed that when the first person starts dancing, other people usually join him?
 
 

 
Have you been wondering why people laugh at you instead of helping you when you need them?
 
 

Do you want to know the strategies to get help?
Or, do you want to know how heinous crimes can happen in the middle of the day with lots of people watching? (If you are interested, google Kitty Genovese. She was stabbed to death near her home. Her murderer left and came back, but during the time, none of her neighbors who were watching called the police or offered help.)

Then, come to the J1F area-wide STEP UP BYSTANDER TRAINING! This Wednesday (20th) at 7pm Hinman Main Lounge! FREE PIZZA. The academic chairs will take points if you attend this training!

Love in ISRC,
J1F CAs
