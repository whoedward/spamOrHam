Hi Supers,

I'm sorry, but I won't be able to make the meeting tomorrow. I'm running for the McSA exec board, and elections are at that time. For shifts, I'll need my Tuesday (3/17) 4-6 shift covered, since I have a final at that time. I went ahead and already released the shift on Shiftplanning.

If there's anything else I should do, just let me know!

Thanks!
Magan
