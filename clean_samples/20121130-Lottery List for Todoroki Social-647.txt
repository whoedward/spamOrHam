Hey everyone, for the last five (Sorry about saying 6 before, my bad) spots for the Todoroki social on Monday, as I said I will be picking names from a list at random at 6pm today. So far here are the names on the list:

Weldon Terrill

Darlene reyes

Michelle Bagwell

Eric Niemeyer

Hannah Martenson

Chang Tang

Christina Chan

Theo Gao

Nathan Lamp

Christopher Walker

Lyon Wang

Eric morales

If your name is not on the list and you want to go to the social, email me so I can add it before the drawing. I will email the people who get the spots and those who don't so don't worry if I don't send out an email exactly at 6pm.

Also, go to the fellows social today!!!!

Have a great weekend,

Anthony
