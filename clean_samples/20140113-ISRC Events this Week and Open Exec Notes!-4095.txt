Reminders/Notes:
Think about if you want to live in ISRC next year, and if you do, if you want to commit to being on Exec Board. Elections will be formally announced on February 2.

International Dinner coming up at the end of February: Think about a recipe you might want to make and if you want to cook with a partner. Recipes must be submitted to Exec Board by January 26.
