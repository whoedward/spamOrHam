Hey ISRC, 

CCI's Stock Market Competition is coming up. This is an easy way to win some cool prizes and connect the RC system. 

Jessie Kang, the person in charge of the competition, asked me to include this info: 

"I'm going to be hosting 2 informational firesides over the next few days about the stock market competition. One is going to be hosted in CCI for the north campus RCs, and one is going to be hosted in Shepard for the south campus RCs. The other RCs should ideally send a representative to those firesides to relay the information on. Some information presented at the fireside will be shared by e-mail at a later date for those who can't make it."

North Campus fireside: Monday April 7th, 6pm, Ayers CCI Main Lounge
South Campus fireside: Monday April 7th, 7pm, Shepard Main Lounge
