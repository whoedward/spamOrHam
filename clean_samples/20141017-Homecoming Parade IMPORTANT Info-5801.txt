Hi ISRC,

If you are planning on marching with ISRC in the parade, please be in the Main Lounge at 4:15pm. We will start walking up at 4:30pm. 

If you cannot be at ISRC by 4:30, meet us on Lincoln St. between Orrington and Sheridan (behind Elder). Please let me know ahead of time, so I can get your name down. 

Everyone who wants to march MUST be on Lincoln by 5pm. 

WEAR YOUR ISRC SHIRTS!!!!!!!!!!

Best,
Esteban
