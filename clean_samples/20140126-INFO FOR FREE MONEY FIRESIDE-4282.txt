Good Morning lovely ISRC-ers!,

We have an amazing events lined up for you this week and one starts tomorrow night with a fireside by a fellow student, Emily Hittner. 

Emily is in the Office of Undergraduate Research and they basically give money to students to do summer projects-- whether they want to travel abroad and learn a new language, get money to great a screen play, or work in a research lab.

The deadlines for these programs are coming up fast, and she wants you to be prepared for all the requirements for these programs 

So Emily has talked to many residential halls and colleges and has an interactive and engaging talk for us! 
Emily will be talking on Monday, tomorrow, January 27th at 7 pm in the 1st floor lounge!

Have a great day!,
CAs
