Hi Everyone,

>> It's no big deal if this can't get covered this week, but if someone could cover my Sunday 4-6 I would really appreciate it. From now on I'm going to have rehearsal at that time, so I probably will have to get that shift permanently covered if that's possible. I'll wait until Thursday's meeting to try to get that worked out, but if anyone thinks they might want to do that, that would be wonderful. Of course, I will be glad to trade shifts as my schedule allows. Please let me know if you are interested in trading shifts for this week or in the future. Thanks!
