Hey, guys,

A lot of discussion topics regarding our club has been arising, and instead of just having me and Natalie trying to figure everything out, we thought that it would be best to have some input from the very members of this club. With that said, after practice this upcoming Saturday (11/2) around 2:20 P.M., we were hoping to be able to just go out for lunch with you all, hang out, and just talk about these topics. I just want to emphasize that everyone in this club is welcome, even if you are new. Your input and opinions will be valuable as we try to figure out how to go forth with this club. Some things we will be talking about are as follows:

-Acquiring a new floor space collectively with other martial arts clubs at the new SPAC area
-Acquiring new mats
-Upcoming tournament plans
-Tournament testing and belt testing for this Fall Quarter
-Club sweatshirts/workout suits
-Feedback on practices
-The very future of our existence

So yeah, just come out, chill with us (even if you have never met us before), and bring your thoughts and opinions. The location of this meeting has not been determined, but I'm just going to put Koco Table out there. If no one offers any other suggestions, we will just be heading to Koco Table. I will update you guys on the location sometime on Friday. Just let either me or Natalie know that you would like to join us so that we can get a head count. And if you have a place you really want to eat, tell us that too. Thanks for your help and participation, guys.

Sincerely,
Davin

P.S. If there is anything I forgot, please let me know.
