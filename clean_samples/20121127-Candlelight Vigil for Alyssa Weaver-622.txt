Candlelight Vigil for Alyssa Weaver

 

Thursday, November 29, 2012

Located at the Rock

8:00 PM

 

In memory of Alyssa Weaver, please join Chi Omega, CCS, the Boxing Club and the Brady Scholars Program in a candlelight vigil commemorating Alyssa’s life. The service will be held at the Rock on Thursday at 8 PM. Several students will speak to reflect on Alyssa’s life, followed by a short reading and musical piece to honor her memory. All are invited to attend and participate.

 

Immediately following the vigil, students may sign the rock as well as write notes of remembrance and condolences to be compiled in a book for the Weaver family. If you wish to write a note to the Weaver family, but are not able to attend, please stop by the Chi Omega house at your own convenience at 1870 Orrington Avenue.

 

We will be collecting donations in Alyssa’s name for a charity determined by her family until January 15th. There will be designated areas at the candlelight vigil, but if you wish to donate at a later date, we ask that any donations be brought to the Chi Omega house. If you wish to donate by check, the benefiting charity information will be updated in the next few days.

 

There will be a formal service to honor Alyssa’s life with the Weaver family, President Schapiro, and other members of the community who knew Alyssa well in January following winter break. Please look for further information about this service as it becomes available.
