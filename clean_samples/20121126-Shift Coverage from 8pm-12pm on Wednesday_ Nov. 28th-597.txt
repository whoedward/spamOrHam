Hey guys,

I mixed up some dates on my calendar. I'm on the board that's choosing the films to be made for the RTVF department through Studio 22 next quarter, but the pitches are taking place at the same time as my shift on Wednesday. Would anyone be able to help out and pick the shift up for me? I'll trade a shift if needed.

Thanks :D

Bobby Ramirez
