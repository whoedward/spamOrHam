    Hi everyone,

    I was wondering if anyone could help me out and take this shift? I have to go take a drug test at a clinic for my summer job within the next 48 hours, and this is one of the only times I have some leeway to go to. Can anyone help me out? I also released the shift on Shiftplanning.

    I'm sorry if this is late notice, but please let me know if you can take it!

    Thanks!
    Magan
