Vote now for your Senator!

Your Residential College Senator represents you in the ASG Senate, the representative body for all undergraduate students.

The Senate tackles campus-level issues and speaks on behalf of all students on topics related to the Northwestern experience and student life (everything from meals to tuition to Evanston relations).

Senators engage with your RC government and students from across campus and lobby administrators to improve your day-to-day life and overall college experience.

Vote for your Senator now. 

Election closes on Friday, Oct. 4, at 7pm CT.
