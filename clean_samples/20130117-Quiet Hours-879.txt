Hi all,

Some people have been coming to me to let me know that they are having trouble sleeping due to the noise level in the suites. I just wanted to remind you guys that quiet hours are in effect after midnight during weekdays and after 1PM during weekends. Please be considerate to your fellow suite and floor mates who may be studying or trying to sleep, especially on weeknights so if you are watching a movie, playing video games or listening to music in the suite, put on your earphones and if there is a group of you out in the suite talking, please keep your voices down to a minimum avoid disturbing others in that suite. Thanks a lot for your help with this guys and have a great weekend!

Best,
Danny
