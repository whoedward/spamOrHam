Norris Prom Theme

Pick the theme you'd most like to see at this year's NORRIS PROM. If you don't know what Norris Prom is, it's when we all get dressed up (jury's still out on whether it's better to dress fancy or to dress tacky), and come to Norris to eat and dance and win prizes. You heard me, PRIZES. So help us pick a theme if you will.
What theme sounds like it would be the most fun for Norris Prom?

    Secret Prom (secret agents, spies, masks, Bond girls welcome)
    90's Prom (should be self explanatory)
    Thrift Shop Prom (ultimate tacky)
    Zombie Prom (I don't want to explain this.)
