Hey NTS,

We are proud to announce that we officially have a Norris Technical Services Manual! It is attached as a .docx file to this email. This manual should have anything and everything you need to function as a tech. If you have any questions at all, please let me or the other supervisors, or Michael know.

Yay!
Tim
