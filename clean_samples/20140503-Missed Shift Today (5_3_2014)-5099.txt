Hi Max,

You failed to show up today for your 2-6 shift. From what I understand, you had a commitment at that time, and as such went to that instead. Please keep in mind that, as Michael said in his recent email, shifts that you take are your responsibility. This means that commitments that overlap with shifts that you have taken need to be accounted for ahead of time.

Please be sure, in the future, to check your calendar more thoroughly to ensure that shifts that you take are shifts that you can take.

Consider this your warning.

If I am mistaken, I apologize in advance, and please let me know. Otherwise, please email either me or ntssupervisors@gmail.com confirming that you received this message. Be sure to hit "reply all."

Regards,
