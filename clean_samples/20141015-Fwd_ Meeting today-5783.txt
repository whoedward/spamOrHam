Hey NTS Supers,

I have a meeting with my AE for CSA at 7:30 so I should be there at least for the first half. These meetings usually don't take long so I'll probably be back within 15 minutes.

But in case I do not make it back in time- this is the shift that I would like covered:

Sunday: 10am-12pm.

Ideally, I would like to be permanently removed but if I can just be covered for this week it would be great.


Thanks!

Sandy
