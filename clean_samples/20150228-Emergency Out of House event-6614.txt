Hi NTS:

An event in McCormick Auditorium got moved to Ryan Auditorium in tech. We need an emergency tech to supervise this Ryan event, and it is already set up. I would personally appreciate it if someone could just sit and monitor in Ryan auditorium until 4pm, and I will help you clean it up.

Thanks,
William Hyun
