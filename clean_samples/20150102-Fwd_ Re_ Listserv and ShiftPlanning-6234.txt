Michael,

Can you add Mikayla to the NTS listserv?

Michael,

Sorry for taking so long to reply. I haven't checked my email since break started. I am not on the NTS Listserv. I tried making a Shiftplanning account, but that expired a few days ago. There was some confusion regarding that account because of the way it was created, so perhaps now that the account expired you can add me? If I can't be added I can use another email account.

    Mikayla,

    Are you on the NTS Listserv or ShiftPlanning? We sent out scheduling information for next quarter over the listserv and we want to make sure you got it. Let us know if you haven't.

    Also, are you able to access ShiftPlanning? Your name is not present on the employee list, and we can't seem to resend your verification email. Can you please check your email to see if you ever got anything about ShiftPlanning? Otherwise, this is a strange issue that will need to be resolved.

    Sorry for all the confusion, it really was just a series of unfortunate events and not something that happens regularly. Hopefully we can get this resolved quickly.

    From,
