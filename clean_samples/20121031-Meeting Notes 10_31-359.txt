New techs need to checklisted by a returning tech. This can be done one item at a time, you don't have to learn all of it at once.

If you sick and unable to make a shift, or going to be more than 15 minutes late to a shift, you need to either call/text the person on shift with you to inform them. If you are late multiple times without notifying the other tech, or excessively late to a shift, we will start issuing warnings.

During shifts, you are expected to do periodic sweeps of the events in the building. This includes peeking your head in to see if there any problems, and seeing if there is any leftover equipment still out from previous events. At the end of the shift, you are expected to wait until at least one other tech from the next shift arrives. You should tell them what events are going on, if there is anything that needs to be cleaned up, etc. Please make sure to clean up events that end during your shift, it sucks when the closing shift has to clean up all of the day's events.

As a rule of thumb, if a theater asks you for any type of equipment not on the sheets do not give it to them. If they insist, go get Michael or Dan, or if they are not there, don't give them anything and tell Michael about it.

We are trying to get a phone and email list together, so please email your phone numbers to andrewjung2015@u.northwestern.edu
