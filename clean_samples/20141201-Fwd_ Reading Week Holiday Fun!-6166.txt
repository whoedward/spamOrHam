Hey!

Sorry to ask again, but would you mind forwarding this to your dorm's listserv? 

During reading week, Habitat, Happiness Club and Campus Kitchens will be co-hosting PB&J sandwich making at Norris to donate to local families in need. Later that day, there will also be Gingerbread Jam, which is a really fun team competition for Gingerbread house building. Cool prizes will include restaurant gift cards to the most decked out Gingerbread houses!

Thanks,
Christina Chan
