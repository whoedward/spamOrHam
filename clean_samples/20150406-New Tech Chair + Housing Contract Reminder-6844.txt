Hey ISRC!

Voting is closed, the results are in, and I am happy to welcome Colin Lynch as our new Tech Chair! Thanks to everyone who voted!

This is also a reminder to sign your housing contract at https://rms.resservices.northwestern.edu if you have not already done so and plan on living on campus next year. The deadline is tonight!

Have a great rest of your Monday!

Emma
