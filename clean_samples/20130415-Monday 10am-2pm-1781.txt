Hey folks,

I realize this is hugely last-minute and unlikely, but a piece of homework took MUCH longer than I'd expected (which is totally my fault for not checking it out sooner), and so I'm looking forward to 4 hours of sleep right now. 

I'm set to work the 10am-12pm and 12-2pm shifts Monday (today); if one of you might possibly be interested in picking up either or both of them, I would owe you big-time and would gladly return the favor.

Again, this is both totally my fault and unreasonably short-notice, and I will make it to the shifts if I have to.  I would really, REALLY love not to have to, though.

All the thanks,

Ryan
