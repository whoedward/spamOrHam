Hey guys,

I'm sure you are all busy studying for finals but when you get the chance please fill out the google doc with your winter quarter schedule sometime this week. Schedules are bound to change but just put down what you can now because it will help us put together a preliminary schedule for next quarter. Thanks to those who have already filled it out and if you haven't filled it out yet it shouldn't take too long.

Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdGlFUWd6WDJnVkt3b3haN25RSDJKaEE

Thanks and good luck with finals!
