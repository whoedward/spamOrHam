Hello!

This is a reminder that you have signed up to compete in the annual RCB Quiz Bowl and Spelling Bee tomorrow. Please arrive to Harris 107 at 11:45 for check-in so that we can start the tournament on time at noon. 

Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the official rules, which can be found here. 

You may have some down time in between your matches, so it might be wise to bring homework or something else to occupy yourself. We will have Panera bagels and coffee when you arrive and Chipotle as a snack later on in the day.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. We can't wait to see you all tomorrow!

RCBest,
Laura
VP Academic Affairs, RCB
