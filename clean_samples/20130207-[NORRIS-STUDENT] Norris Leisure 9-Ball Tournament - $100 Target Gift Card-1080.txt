Hey Everyone,
 
The Game Room is hosting a Leisure 9-Ball Tournament for all Norris employees, both student and full-time staff. The tournament is open to players of all skill levels, entry is free, and you get to schedule your own matches. Matches shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes, so you should be able to schedule matches between classes, on your lunch break, or just before you leave to go home. 
 
The tournament will start Monday, February 18th and the final round and matches will be held Friday, March 15th at 6 pm. The winner of the tournament will receive a $100 Target Gift Card.
 
It's open to players of all skill levels, so feel free to join even if you just want to enjoy some free games, meet some new people, or have a good time playing against your friends.
 
I've attached more specifics on the rules and tournament layout if you're interested.
 
To join the tournament, email your name, contact info, and your Norris department to me, Harry, at harrisonbriggs2014@u.northwestern.edu.
 
Thanks, and good luck!
 
Harry
