Hi all,

RCB DM Trivia Night is not just for members of the ISRC DM team!!!  It's for anyone who loves trivia and wants a philanthropy point!  Do you guys remember the email that Kyle sent on Sunday about trivia?  Here's the info again:
RCB DM Trivia Night!
Thursday, January 16, 6:00pm
@Buffalo Wild Wings
$5 Suggested Donation goes to your RC's DM team
Winning team gets a $25 BWW giftcard
Every team must have a fellow or master!

Like other DM trivia nights, it will take place at Buffalo Wild Wings, and there is a suggested $5 donation. But there are two twists that make this trivia night more fun:

1) Only teams representing res colleges will be allowed to participate
2) Every team must have at least one fellow/master!

Unfortunately, I can't go, because I have a class that ends at 6:50.  However, if several ISRCers do want to do this, Cheryl said she will be the requisite member of the master staff representing ISRC.  She's supposed to be at a Willard event, but she said she'll skip that for us. :)  This means that I need to know ASAP if you want to do this so I can let Cheryl know what to plan for.  Once again, if you want to go to trivia, email me soon!  Thanks so much!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
