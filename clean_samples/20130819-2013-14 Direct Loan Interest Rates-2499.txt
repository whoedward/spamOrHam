Dear Student,

Last Friday President Obama signed the Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013. As a student who was offered a Federal Direct Loan for the 2013-14 academic year, we are contacting you to outline the changes to the loan program.

This Act re-establishes the interest rates for new Federal Direct Student Loans. The interest rates for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014 to students in an undergraduate program are as follows:
     Direct Federal Stafford Loan: 3.86% (previously set to be 6.8%)
     Direct Federal Parent PLUS Loan: 6.41% (previously 7.9%)

Origination fees (which are deducted from each loan disbursement) on all Federal Direct Loans have also changed as of July 1, 2013 as a result of sequestration. They are as follows:
     Direct Federal Stafford Loan: 1.051% (previously 1%)
     Direct Federal Parent PLUS Loan: 4.204% (previously 4%)

The above interest rates and fees will be automatically applied to your Federal Direct Loans, there is no additional action needed on your part to receive the lower interest rates.

Be sure to check your award to ensure you have accepted your loan(s) as well as your to-do list on CAESAR to ensure all required loan documents have been completed.

For more information on these changes, please visit our websiteâ€™s Direct Loan Changes page.

Sincerely,
