I just got in to campus--I'll cover the whole thing.  Michael (W.), you still want to come help set up for an hour?  Would totally appreciate it.

Thanks all!

    I can be there but only from 5-6 PM (maybe to set up?), after that I have a student organization meeting.

        Hello Techs,
        We have a dinner tonight from 5-8pm in Louis...it's the only thing happening tonight.  I really need someone to step up and take these hours.  I can't guarantee it but there may be LOF involved.

        Thanks,

        Michael

        Hey all,

        As Michael said, there was some confusion about when the schedule was supposed to start. We need help 3pm-closing time, so please let us know if you can help out!

        Best,
        Tim
