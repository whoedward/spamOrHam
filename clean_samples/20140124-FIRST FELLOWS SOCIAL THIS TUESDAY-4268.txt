Hi All,

Now that we are back in the thick of things, we thought that you might need a study break, (read: free food paid for by the dorm). There will be a fellows social at Tapas Barcelona at 7PM on Tuesday January 28th. Note that not only will there be delicious food and our awesome fellows, but that your too-broke-to-eat-out self will be given 20 dollars to subsidize the cost of your meal!

Furthermore, in order to avoid certain unsavory situations, note that all attendants of the social will be provided immunity from assassination extending from the half hour before the social, to half an hour after it ends.

There will be limited spots, so I will be releasing the spots in batches: 5 spots to be released tomorrow (Saturday) at 3PM, 3 spots released on Sunday at 9AM, and 3 spots will be held in reserve as a lottery. Emails will be sent out at those times, and it's first come first serve. Happy hunting!

Cheers,
