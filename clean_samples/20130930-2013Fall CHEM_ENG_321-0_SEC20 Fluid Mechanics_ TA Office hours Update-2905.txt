Hi,

Wednesday office hours starting this week will be held in the ChBE Conference room,  the room is across the hall from the main office in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department - just before the doors leading out into the courtyard from the E Wing.

To summarize:

    Tuesday 3-4 in E225
    Wednesday 3-4 in ChBE Conf room
    Thursday 2:30 - 3:30 in E225


Best,

Liz Wylie
