Hey everyone,

First and foremost, I want to thank all of you for being so understanding as some of us were preparing for the KASA Show for the past few weeks. I understand that it may have been really inconvenient at times, and I really appreciate you guys for being so patient with us.

Well, we're almost done preparing for the show now, and it will take place this Friday at 8 P.M. at Ryan Auditorium. We are the opening act, so if you guys are free and want something to do on Friday night, come cheer us on as well as the other acts that are performing. I expect it to be a great time for everyone.

We will be returning to normal practices from here on out. Once again, thank you for your understanding.

Yours truly,
Davin
