Hey Magan,

If you didn't have any shifts that you needed taken, there isn't much more to do. We'll let it slide, given that you've got a great track record. Just try to remember next time!

Cheers,
Ethan

    Hi guys,

    I'm so sorry to say, but I had a required Tour Guide Kickoff meeting, which happens once a quarter, which was why I wasn't there. I was going to email the supervisor email, but all I can say is that it slipped my mind due to a hectic first week of spring. I'm really sorry for any inconvenience, but won't happen again. Please let me know if there's anything else I should do.

    Thanks,
    Magan
