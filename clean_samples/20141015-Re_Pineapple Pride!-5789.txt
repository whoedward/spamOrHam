Hi Everyone!

Thank you to those who entered the drawing. Nathan Mills has the honor of being in the pineapple costume for Friday's parade. 

Have a great night everyone!

Best,
Esteban

    Hi ISRC!

    Remember that tonight after munchies, we will be decorating the ISRC homecoming banner for the parade. You will receive a service point for sharing your artistic ability. 

    To decide who is going to wear the Pineapple Costume for the parade, we are going to have a drawing. 

    Please email me by 10pm TONIGHT if you would like your name to be entered. 

    After 10, I will draw a name from all those entered, and that person will get to wear the Pineapple costume. 

    Hope you have a great Wednesday. Good luck on any midterms you may have!!

    ISRCLove,
    Esteban
