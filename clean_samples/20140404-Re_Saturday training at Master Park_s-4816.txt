Also, there will still be regular practice at Blomquist tomorrow 12-2pm. Remember, we've got our biggest demo of the year to prepare for!

    Hey all,
     
    This is the final reminder! Tomorrow we'll be training at Master Park's dojang from 11-12:30.
    Those of you who are coming, we'll leave from Blomquist at exactly 10:30am. Both Eric and Rui are driving, so there's no problem with space. And we will be back at Blomquist between 1 and 1:15pm so that we can also practice for the KASA show!
     
    Bring your uniform, sparring gear, and water.

    If you haven't yet, please email me if you want to come so that you don't get left behind. If you're running late tomorrow morning or you can't make it, text me at 517-643-4694.
     
    See you tomorrow!
    Andrew
