Hi all,

After talking to some of you about recent issues on our floor, i.e. messes in the kitchen and showers, I have compiled a list of Community Standards for our floor. 

1) Clean up the kitchen, do not leave your dirty dishes out in the sink
2) Respect others' kitchen appliances and utensils 
3) Turn off lights and air conditioning when there is no one in the suites.
4) Keep tables clean in the suites and clean up after yourself
5) Keep your voices down when others are working and studying in the suite; Use headphones when you are listening to music or watching a movie
6) If you leave food in the suite, it is free for grabs
7) Keep the suites clean and pick up your own trash
8) Do not leave miscellaneous items in the suite that you do not want others to share/use
9) Make sure you keep the showers clean and remove all hair from the drain and walls when you are done
10) Respect the housekeeping staff

Let me know if there are some standards, as seen above, that you want to change or if you have any other community standards that you would like to add to the list by the end of the week. If not, I will send out a final copy of the community standards next week and post a copy of these in each suite. Have a great week guys!

Best,
Danny
