Hi April,

My name is Ethan Robison, and I am an applicant (mid processing) for the undergraduate applications developer position. I have already been interviewed and returned my standard forms (SF's) and other paperwork.


There are, however, details that have to be discussed and arranged here at my university, particularly the dates when I will be working (this is especially important for co-op positions, as these require breaks in academic study).


With that said, I am unsure whom to contact concerning position details or anything of that nature. I am emailing to ask you if there is any number or email address that I might use to sort these things out.


Please let me know if there is any additional information that you might need.


Thank you very much for your help,
