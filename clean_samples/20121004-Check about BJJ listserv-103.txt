Hi everyone,

I just added you all to the BJJ listserv. You should have gotten a notification telling you this. If you didn't please let me know. 

If you don't want to be on this listserv, follow the directions here: http://www.it.northwestern.edu/listserv/howto.html#i2554
or ask me to remove you.

Thanks!
Jacob
