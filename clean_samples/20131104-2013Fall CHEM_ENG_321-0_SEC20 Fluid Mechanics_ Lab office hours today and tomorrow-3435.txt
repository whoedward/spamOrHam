Dear Class,

Office hours for the lab report due this week will be held today at 3-4pm and tomorrow at 9-10am, both in Tech E225.  If you have simple questions or cannot meet during those times, please let me know.

Also, on Friday there was a piece that went missing partway through the day (the sharp orifice I was using for demonstration purposes) that I have still be unable to locate.  If you could check to make sure you didn't accidentally take it out of the lab, that would be great.

Thanks,

Erica
