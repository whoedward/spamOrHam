This luncheon will be an opportunity to interact with other student leaders, discuss upcoming events, and help improve the McCormick student group experience. Additionally, Dean Ottino will be there, and will be talking about some student groups and initiatives that are on their way for McCormick. The lunch is free and delicious!
