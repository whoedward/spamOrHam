It's happening. I'm finally getting back to teaching Muay Thai. I have a lesson plan and everything. 

We'll be going over the basics, but I plan on having us quickly progress in to more advanced / practical techniques and getting some light sparring going. 

So, if you're at all interested in learning striking, come out to Blomquist from 11 am - 12 THIS SUNDAY.

If you plan on being there, email me to RSVP so I can gauge class size.

Love,
Sean
