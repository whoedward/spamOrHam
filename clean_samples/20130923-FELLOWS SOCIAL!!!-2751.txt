Hi all!

This announcement was made at the open exec meeting last night, but in case anybody missed it, we will have our first fellows social today! The fellows social will be held in the Main Lounge at 4PM. There will be heaps of delicious Thai Food and a bunch of awesome performances by Boomshaka!

In addition to that, this is a great opportunity to meet the many amazing professors who are affiliated with our dorm, and have a lot of fun while you're at it. 

See you guys there!

Cheers,
Chang Tang
