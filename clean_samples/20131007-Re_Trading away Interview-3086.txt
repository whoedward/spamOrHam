Holy crap thanks for reminding me, she took a job at the cashier's office so we're not doing the interview anymore.

    Supes,

    Can someone take my interview slot tomorrow? I'm supposed to interview Kaitlyn Vines tomorrow @ 3:30 PM w/Ethan, but I really really need to go to Career Services walk-in hours. I would seriously appreciate it.
