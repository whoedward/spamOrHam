I am sorry to clog your inbox; I'm concerned the TIC conference room might be too hard for some people to find. We will be meeting in Kresge 4-355. Promise I won't change it again!

    Hello all,

    I just received notice that my room request was denied...SO we will instead be meeting in the Theatre Interpretations Center east conference room. The room is upstairs in the Theatre building behind the faculty offices, I'll put up signs to guide y'all to it, but call me if you get super lost.

    See you at 10:30!

        Howdy everyone,

        This is a reminder about our very first production meeting for Soul Conductor tomorrow at 10:30pm in Fisk 1115. The meeting should take 30-45 minutes. 

        Please read the script before we meet, and come with some general idea of your design plan. I'll hand out tax exempt forms, and expectation sheets to everybody.

        Also please update any incorrect/incomplete information on our contact list: https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aotx_YnmK_WOdFBOcFpQSDZIYWJHWmhyR1JFMWZoYWc&usp=drive_web#gid=0

        See y'all tomorrow!
