Dittmar Dinner and Discussion
with Professor Emeritus Paul Arntson

Applying Claude Steele's Identity Contingencies and Stereotype Threats to People Labeled with Physical, Mental, and Cognitive Disabilities:  How are they applicable and what can be done about them?

This dinner and discussion will examine if and how Claude Steele's analysis of identity contingencies and stereotype threats apply to people labeled physically, mentally, and cognitively disabled.  Are the remedies he proposes useful for disabled identities or are the every day cues in the environment (physical and social access, education, jobs, housing, "specialness", adequate income support, etc.) much more important to change?  How can "regularly abled" people interact with people with disabilities without feeling anxious and therefore avoiding the interactions? An expert panel will be part of the dinner-discussion evening.    

Dinner is free and open to the public. Space is limited and filled on a first come first serve basis. RSVP is required.

RSVP here.
