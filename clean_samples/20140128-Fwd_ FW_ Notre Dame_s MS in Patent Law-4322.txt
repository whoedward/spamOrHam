Hello – My name is Karen Deak and I am the director of a Master’s program at the University of Notre Dame – the MS in Patent Law. I recently reached out to you and some other campus groups offering to talk to your group about careers in patent law. I am pleased to let you know that I will be at Northwestern on February 6 speaking to the EnvEUS and SWE student chapters. Even though your group was not one that expressed interest, I would appreciate your help in letting your members know about my visit. If you think your group may be interested in attending, please pass on the attached flier and note below.

 

 

 

Patent attorneys and patent agents help inventors get patents to protect their ideas. Patent attorneys and patent agents usually work at law firms, or at companies where researchers create new products. They work in all fields of technology – from electrical engineering to biology. Patent agents especially are in high demand in the legal market! So, if someone has a technical background, and an interest in the law, this field is an exciting career choice for them.

 

Notre Dame’s new MS in Patent Law prepares people for practice as patent agents. What’s a patent agent? In short, a patent agent is similar to a patent attorney, except that s/he hasn’t spent three years in law school so isn’t a lawyer. As far as helping inventors get patents, a patent agent is exactly the same as a patent attorney (although an attorney can do all of that other boring attorney stuff, like write wills!).

 

The MS in Patent Law is accepting applications now for our 2014-2015 class. Our graduates have enjoyed good success in their job searches – from our first class of seven students, six have jobs at law firms now.

 

In addition to being on your campus, we are holding two informational sessions in February:

Best,

Karen
