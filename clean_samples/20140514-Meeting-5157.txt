There's a tournament today that I signed up for. If I lose I'll definitely be there on time. If not then I'll miss part/all of the meeting. In case I don't get there in time, I would like my Saturday 6 - 8 covered. I am available to pick up shifts after 2 pm tomorrow. Can't friday. Can't saturday. I'm free after 3 pm on Sunday. And after 2 pm I can cover any shifts Mon/Tue/Wed (i strongly prefer 4 hour shifts to 2 hour ones)
