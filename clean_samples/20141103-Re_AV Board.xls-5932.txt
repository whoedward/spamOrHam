Hey Michael,
These are the out of house events. They were covered, they were just not put in shiftplanning. I just put them on the schedule. My bad on that.

    Out of House Tuesday 11/4 12-3PM The Great Room  - > Alexandra 12-2; Ethan 1-3; Alex S 12-1

    Out of House Wednesday 11/5 9AM-12PM The Great Room- Hannah  & Max Z 9am-12

Alexandra will be shadowing on Tuesday.

    I don’t see Tuesday or Wednesday’s Great room events on Shift planning.  I saw Dan had added these events and sent out an updated AV board last Wednesday.  My Hope is you just forget to add them to Shiftplanning.  If not we need these events covered ASAP.

     

    I can assist with Tuesday set-up, an then we can leave the equipment in the back room for Wednesday morning.

     

    Please update me with who is covering the shift.
