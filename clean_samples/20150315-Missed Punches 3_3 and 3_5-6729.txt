Hey Brett

Just a quick heads up about some missed swipes that you had on 3/3 and 3/5 (I know that it was forever ago). Really, I just wanted to make sure that you remember the importance of swiping in and out correctly. If you have any questions, or if you remember the circumstances surrounding those particular missed swipes, please let me or one of the other supers know.

Regards,
