Hello, lovely ISRCers,

I know some of you have been wondering about opportunities to get philanthropy points outside of the ISRC People Auction (btw, like the page if you haven't already! - https://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction). Today at our closed exec meeting, Jonas pointed out that volunteering for Campus Kitchens is always an option. I don't have details for you, but if you want to learn more, you can email Jonas (jonascarlsson2016@u.northwestern.edu). Also, like the NU Campus Kitchens FB page! (https://www.facebook.com/NUCampusKitchen)  If you've already volunteered for Campus Kitchens this quarter, have not notified me, and would like philanthropy points for it, just shot me an email. Finally, if you volunteer in any other capacity and think it might be worth a point, email me and I'll let you know if it counts. Thanks, and let me know if you have any other questions/concerns/suggestions.

Happy Valentine's Day!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
