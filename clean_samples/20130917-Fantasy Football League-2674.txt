Hey everyone!
I created a fantasy football league through ESPN, but there can't be more than 20 teams in the league. Could you please respond to this email before this Friday if you want to play so that I can make another league if I have to? Also, I would like to get the league play started ASAP since football season already began. Also, if you respond, I will send an email invitation through ESPN to join the league. To play, you need an account, but you can easily register if you have a Facebook account. The draft is an Autopick draft, which means you set your own pre-draft rankings, and ESPN will draft your players for you based on everyones rankings (a live draft would take too long considering that up to 20 people will play).
Thanks,
Matt
