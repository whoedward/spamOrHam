Hey everyone,
 
Judging from the Doodles, I think it makes sense to just start at 5PM for both days of the social and go until whenever.
 
Currently the plan is to have this happen at my apartment, the address is 2531 Jackson Ave., Apt. 2W, right across from Ryan Field on the corner of Central and Jackson.
 
The easiest way to get here on Friday would be to 1.  get a ride from someone or 2. take the intercampus or Ryan Field shuttle to the Central/Jackson stop (that’s the one right before the final Ryan Field stop).
 
On Saturday the shuttles don’t run, so the easiest way to get here would be getting a ride.  The other option is the 201 bus to Central/Ashland or for those near the CTA stations, the Purple Line north to Central.
 
If you need it, my number is 618-316-3961.
 
Hope to see you there!
Allan
