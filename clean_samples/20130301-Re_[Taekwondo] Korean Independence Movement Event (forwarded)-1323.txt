    Hi NU Taekwondo!

    I'm Lisa, and I'd like to introduce the meaning of the March 1st for Korea to you. 

    Korea was under the Japanese colonial rule between 1910 and 1945. After Woodrow Wilson declared National Self-determination in 1918, Korean civil leaders decided to pull out a unified and peaceful protest against the Japanese rule. On the February 8th of 1919, Korean students in Tokyo declared independence of Korea. It incited the movement on the March 1st. Thirty-three civil leaders in coordination with different political and religious groups planned declaration of independence in Seoul. On the March 1st, 5,000 students joined the movement. Many of them were only middle school or high school students. 

    They declared independence and marched peacefully. The Japanese military destroyed the movement and 130 people were arrested on that day. But the movement spread throughout Korea and lasted for two months. More than a million people participated in the movement and Japan reacted with force and violence.

    The rest of the world was sympathetic with Korea's situation, but some powerful governments responded indifferently due to political complexities. The March 1st movement failed in the end, but it showed that Koreans were able to stand against injustice and oppression. Japan had to turn its colonial policy from repressive rule to "culture rule" (aka brainwash). The legacy of the March 1st movement also was social and economic foundations for the Korean independence later on. 
       
    Turning away from the serious history lesson, I should talk about what we're doing for the March 1st. 

    My friend and I created a posting for the March 1st. Below is the message and I've attached a link to an informative video. 

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the March 1st of 1919, 5,000 students just like us sparked the Korean independence movement against the Japanese colonial rule through a non-violent march. 
    In this movement that spread throughout Korea for 2 months, 7,500 were killed and 47,000 were arrested or executed.
    Whether you are of Korean origin or not, please take a moment to commemorate the courageous students who sacrificed themselves to defend what they believe in. 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It will be really, really appreciated if you could spread words by posting the message along with the video I attached on the March 1st. Please feel free to modify the message or create your own. It will be even better if you could change your prof pic to the Korean national flag.

    Whether you're Korean, American, or from somewhere else, it's important to appreciate the courage of those who sacrificed because they bequeathed us the freedom we enjoy today.

    Also, I'm gonna talk about the March 1st movement at the end of the KASA meeting: 8PM February 28th.
    Wanna know more about the Korean independence movement and the March 1st? Come meet me at the KASA meeting! The meeting will be held at the Multicultural Center.

    And a big hug to those who read this long message! Thank YOU!
