It's for 6 weeks on Wednesdays from 6-8 PM so I won't be able to come to the meetings until... like the third week of February. Keep me posted on what's happening at the meetings~ and txt me if you guys are having trouble covering some shifts during the meeting. I'll keep my phone next to me just in case... but only in emergency, txt me haha
