Hi Norris!

Just reminding everyone to enter our Fall Facebook Photo Contest... BECAUSE YOU COULD WIN AN IPAD MINI.

Just post a photo to the Norris Facebook page showing how you show your Wildcat pride by Monday, December 3 at midnight... AND YOU COULD WIN AN IPAD MINI!

We're looking for more creative entries for our Top 5, and I know the Norris Staff won't disappoint.  

Can't wait to see what you come up with!

Love,
NorMar
