... and the last of the IM e-mails for the quarter depending on what happens tomorrow...

What's that? What's happening tomorrow?



!!!!!I'M GLAD YOU ASKED!!!!!

UNO: basketball. Our last game of the season! We are playing against our good friends at Chapin at 4:00 PM, at Blomquist gym - meet at the lobby at 3:40 PM so we can head over there and warm up a little. Bring your WILDCards!

For real though, thank you to everybody that showed up this season. I'm so proud of you ISRC!! Special shout out to Spencer Martens, our good free agent friend.

DOS: hockey. Our last game before the playoffs. After an INSANE CLUTCH WIN last week (read: we played with 4 people and still pulled off an OT 3-2 win) we are in good position to make the playoffs! We will be playing with our good friends at Chapin against Willard/CCS/Shepard at 5 PM. Wear WHITE - if you are coming and you are not playing basketball with us at 4 MEET US AT PATTEN SINCE WE WILL BE LEAVING FOR PATTEN STRAIGHT FROM BASKETBALL (WILL GARRISON, PLEASE BRING PEOPLE AT ISRC AND MEET US AT PATTEN BY 5 PM WITH WILDCARDS/GAME FACES/WHITE SHIRTS)

Hockey players: We should be done with hockey by 5:45, in time to pregame for ID

I LOVE MY IM PLAYERS

THANK YOU ALL FOR A LOT OF FUN AND A LOT OF HEART

Paul Kim
