Hey!

Thanks for letting us know.  Norris is not open on Memorial Day, but we'll get your other shifts covered.  Good luck at the Baja race!

    Hello,

    I'm leaving for the Baja race in Kansas tomorrow morning so I won't be able to make it to the meeting this week.  I don't remember if we got my Friday 8am-12pm covered at the last meeting, and I'll also need next Monday's 10am-2pm covered, since we won't be back until that evening. (Is Norris open for Memorial Day?)

    Thanks,

    Will
