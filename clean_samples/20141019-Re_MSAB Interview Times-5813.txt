Hey Everyone,

I am currently finalizing interview times during the week next week for Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday!  Please let me know if any time commitments have changed.  Also, one person did not put their name so it just says Participant.  Please check to see if that was you.

I will send out your time and the location of your interview before the end of the night so look out for that email.

Hope everyone is having a nice Sunday!

Jason
