SAFC ELECTIONS ARE THIS WEDNESDAY THE 28th!

What: 6 open account executive seats on the Student Activities Finance Committee (3 for past or present Senators, 3 for non-Senators)
When: Wednesday November 28th at 7:30pm

Where: The Northwestern Room on the 2nd floor of Norris

Why: The Student Activities Finance Committee oversees and advises all 40 student groups with A-Status recognition by the Associated Student Government. In addition, the committee is also given the responsibility to distribute and ensure the proper use of the Student Activities Fee, a pool which currently totals over $1,200,000. The account executive will be assigned to directly work with three or four groups, consulting on various issues from programming implementation to abiding by student group guidelines. In addition, the account executive is also responsible for auditing student group accounts each month. Serving on the SAFC is a great way to immerse yourself in Northwestern's student group culture while developing essential business and analytical skills.

If you're interested please contact ASG's Financial Vice President (girish@u.northwestern.edu) to learn more about the process and the position.
