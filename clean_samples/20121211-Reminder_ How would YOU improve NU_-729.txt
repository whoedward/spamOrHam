Dear Ethan,
 
You are receiving this message because you have not yet completed the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee (UBPC) survey. In February, the UBPC will present the results from this survey to the President, Provost, and other administrators. Having a large representative sample of the student body is imperative, so your help is critical and much appreciated.

Please take 15-20 minutes of your time to share your thoughts about the current state of student life at Northwestern? You’ll find the survey at www.ubpcsurvey.com.  In order to have your responses counted – and in order for you to be entered into a drawing for 5 $25 Visa gift cards – you must complete the survey in full by Sunday, December 16 at 5pm.
 
Don't miss out on your opportunity to tell President Schapiro how you want the University to change in the coming years.

Thanks very much for your help.

Sincerely,

Chase Eck
Chairman, Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee
