1861 Sheridan Road is an address close enough to work. If you wait near there I can come right out to you.

    Oh I guess I'll have to kill some time with Hallie then; I'll see if I can arrange to pick you up near your class; let me know where it is

I usually take Western to Asbury to Green Bay but I could go up to Sheridan and pick you up near school someplace. I can give you a call tomorrow when I know the timing, does that sound ok?

It could give us a little more time ( I'm coming from N Rockwell and I usually take Asbury to Green Bay) I am trying to get to an acupuncture appt by 5 as well
