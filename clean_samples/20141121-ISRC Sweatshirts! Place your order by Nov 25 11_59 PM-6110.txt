Hey ISRC!

You can order the ISRC Holiday sweatshirts now! They cost $20 and part of the sales goes towards the ISRC DM team so support Team Pineapple by buying a sweatshirt! They will be shipped to ISRC during finals week so you will be able to pick them up then. You have to place your orders by Tuesday, November 25 at 11:59 PM to get them!
