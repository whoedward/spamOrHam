Again, everyone gave amazing performances. We blew the top off that place.

    Awesome job everybody.  I wish I could have made it.  I really think the quality of the demo has improved quite a bit from previous years, in just about all aspects.  At least one thing I'd like to mention is that the quality of the demo is a function of the time and dedicate made by everybody who contributes.  Its obvious that everybody put a lot of time and hard work into making the demo this good.  Allan you did a good job with the editing, I am a bit curious to hear all the screaming fans in the unedited version.  

    Anyway, back to thesis writing :)

        First of all, awesome job to everyone who performed and helped out in the KASA show.  You all were excellent.  Also a big thank you to Davin for organizing and shouldering most of the work for the show, as well as Jihoon for his choreography.
         
        To those of you who came out to watch, a big thank you to you too!  If you couldnâ€™t make it, never fear, another big thank you to Rui for getting us someone to videotape it all.  Rui, thank your friend for us again the next time you see him.  You can find a video of the performance here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNztnTvBgs0&feature=youtu.be
         
        This video is a composite edit with retouched sound so you can hear it better.  The raw videos (including all the screaming) will be uploaded later.
