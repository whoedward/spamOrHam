Hi EA1 Students,
Your final exam grade and the weighted score for the class should be up on Blackboard. If something is missing or you think is miscalculated, please let me know as soon as possible. The calculations are listed in the syllabus. The 5% for labs is divided as 3% for attendance and 1% for each of the lab project parts.

If you would like to see your final exam, please see the following people:

Section 20: Prof. Freeman (M396)
Section 21: Prof. Freeman (M396)
Section 22: Dr. Nguyen (L313)
Section 23: Dr. Nguyen (L313)

Have a great winter break!
