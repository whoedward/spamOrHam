Hey, guys,

This email really only applies to those who only recently started coming out to this club, so if that is not you, you can safely ignore this email.

If you wish to keep coming out to our practices, we would greatly appreciate it if you guys could fill out this Waiver and Consent Form for Tae Kwon Do-WTF at http://www.nuim.net/clubsports/waiver_page_1.php. University rules, not mine :)

Also, I think I forgot to mention previously what our weekly schedule is. On Mondays, we focus a lot more on forms, one-step sparring, and self-defense. On Wednesdays, we focus more on sparring techniques and kicking drills. Saturday practices are days when members can work on whatever they want to.

If you have any questions or concerns, please either shoot me or Natalie an email, and we will try to answer them the best we can. Thanks~!

Yours,
Davin
