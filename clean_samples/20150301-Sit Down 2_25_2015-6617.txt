Hi Chen,

This is a follow-up email to our sit-down this Wednesday after the meeting. As I expressed then, no disciplinary action is being taken at this time. We just want to make sure that things go smoothly and that you feel comfortable reaching out to the supers or to any of the pro staff if you need anything.

That said, this also serves as a record that we had the sit down, and that you have acknowledged the conversation. This serves as your first warning about attendance.

Please feel free to email me, any of the other supervisors, or Chris if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,
