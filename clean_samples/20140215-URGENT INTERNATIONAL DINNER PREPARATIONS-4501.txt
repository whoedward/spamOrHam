Preparations for International Dinner have begun.

The library off the main lounge is a staging area, and is thus a NO GO ZONE for the next week.

Furthermore, the refrigerators will be used to store ingredients, thus you must clear any items you have in the communal refrigerators. You have until Monday night. After that, anything you may have in the fridges may be disposed of as we see fit.

Thank you for your cooperation.
