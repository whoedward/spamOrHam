Hey, guys,

If you guys aren't new to the club, you guys can and should just ignore this email.

As for those who are new, I just want to welcome you guys once again and give you guys a brief overview of our club and what we do.

We practice Tae Kwon Do, the most popular martial arts in terms of the number of practitioners. It focuses a lot more on using the legs to deal powerful kicks, but it also focuses on a myriad of other self-defense techniques (punches, blocks, holds, etc.). Among other things, your flexibility and agility should significantly improve as you train with us.

For those who do not know our practice schedule, we train on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8-10 P.M. and Saturdays from 12-2 P.M. On Mondays and Wednesdays, the 8-9 P.M. session will be focused on training beginners and color belts, whereas the 9-10 P.M. session is mainly for black belt members. All members are more than welcome to stay for both sessions, if they wish to do so.

On Mondays, we tend to focus more on forms and self-defense techniques.

On Wednesdays, we focus on kicking drills and sparring.

Saturdays are treated as a workshop session for members to train any aspect of the art that they wish to do so.

I think that is enough for now. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let either me or Natalie Kim (the other co-president, jeongkim2016@u.northwestern.edu) know. Thanks, and I look forward to seeing all of you guys soon.

Yours,
Davin
