Be on the lookout for MIMO collection bins in off-campus and on-campus locations!

MIMO is a nonprofit that collects unwanted, usable items from students during move-out and resells to incoming students at affordable prices in the beginning of the school year. 100% of proceeds are donated to local charities.
