    Hey all,

    It totally slipped my mind to send this email sooner, but I'm in a show this weekend, and we have a performance at 2pm tomorrow, so I will not be able to work my 12-2 shift. If someone could cover that I would be SO grateful. Thanks guys! I hope you all have great weekends!


    Best,
    Jake Degler
