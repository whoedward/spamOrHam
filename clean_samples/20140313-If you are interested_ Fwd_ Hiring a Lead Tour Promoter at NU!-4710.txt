Hey Jeong!

I am personally reaching out to you with a paid internship opportunity because of your involvement in Taekwondo at Northwestern University. I am looking to hire an outgoing, enthusiastic, and involved student like you, to become the Lead Microsoft Windows 8 Tour Promoter on your campus. I would also appreciate you taking the time to share this opportunity with your peers involved in Taekwondo.

All majors are welcome to apply and it would be a particularly good fit for students interested in Marketing, Communication, or Technology!  This program is an outstanding resume builder, a fun opportunity to interact with your peers while earning money, and a great way to gain experience with a short-term commitment that works with your schedule.
