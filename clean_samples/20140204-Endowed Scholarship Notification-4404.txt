Dear Ethan Robison,

The Financial Aid Committee is pleased to inform you that you have been selected to receive the C.J. Luther Scholarship for the 2013-2014 academic year. The donor specified that this award should go to a male undergraduate student who demonstrates financial need and academic achievement.  These endowed scholarship funds have replaced a portion of your Northwestern Scholarship and have been applied to your account.

The Financial Aid Office depends on endowments like yours and the generosity of donors to meet the full, demonstrated need of all financial aid applicants.  Although being named the recipient of an endowed scholarship does not mean that you are receiving additional financial assistance, it is an honor and an acknowledgment of your achievements at Northwestern. Many students list the receipt of an endowed scholarship on their resumes.  

On behalf of the Financial Aid and Development Offices, we offer you our congratulations. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Sincerely,

The Financial Aid Committee
