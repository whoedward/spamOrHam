 Hi everyone,

Our meeting tomorrow is from 7-8pm in the Casbah Room. This will be our last meeting this quarter, so if you have any shifts that need to be given away during Finals week, make sure to either come to the meeting or email us. If you cannot make the meeting, please email ntssupervisors@gmail.com by noon tomorrow with your reason.

Thanks,
