Hey everyone,

I just got this email from a CA in Bobb. She wants to do a fireside about self defense and I was wondering if anyone would like to assist her. I feel like I would not know enough to actually help out for this, so I'm throwing a call to the listserv.

Her email is  lajjapatel2015@u.northwestern.edu

My name is Lajja Patel and I got your email from my friend PJ Huang. I'm a CA in Bobb-McCulloch and I'm trying to plan a fireside on self-defense. I understand that you are part of Brazilian Jijitsu and I was wondering if you'd be willing to come in during a weekday or weekend in November to come tell us about your club and perhaps show us some self-defense moves. Please let me know if you're interested in coming in to talk with the Bobb McCulloch community. We'd be really happy if you could come join us. Again, our theme is Self-defense and I thought it would be very fitting if you could join us. 

Thanks, 
Lajja Patel
