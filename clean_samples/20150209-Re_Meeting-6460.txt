Hello Chris,

I looked at the WhenIsGood poll we had done at the beginning of this quarter.  It looks like earliest time we have that we can all meet is at 5PM on Wednesdays.  If this is too late for you to stay, please let us know and we'll try to figure out something that works better for your schedule.

Best,
Christina

    Hello Supervisors,

    I mentioned this to Christina last week, I’d like to have a meeting with all of you sometime soon.   Is there a time in the near future, when you are all available during business hours?  Can you coordinate together, and propose a time?  Thanks!
