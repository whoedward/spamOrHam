Hi Max and Juan, 

This morning a laptop was found in the Evans room from an event on Sunday. ShiftPlanning shows you two as the techs scheduled for the Sunday close, meaning that it is your responsibility to sweep the building and clean up any equipment left out from the day's events. 

Please let me know if you have any clarifications or concerns regarding this matter (i.e. if only one of you was responsible for sweeping the 1st floor, etc.). Otherwise please beware that this will be considered your first infractions and this email constitutes a verbal warning. 

-Bobby Ramirez
