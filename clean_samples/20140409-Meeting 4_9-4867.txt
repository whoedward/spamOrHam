Hello supervisors.

I have a show today and it is in Norris but I will be unable to attend the meeting due to performing. I will coordinate with John about how to cover the shift / I will take care of anything that needs to be set beforehand and I can watch over the event while I'm there since it will be in McCormick Auditorium.

Thanks!
