Hello Everyone!

Professor Notestein wanted to give you all an early heads up that the annual AIChE Chicago section student poster session is the evening of April 10 at UIC. It is the poster session, dinner, and a talk, all for quite cheap. (usually $5-$10). There are prizes for the best poster. He doesn't have all the details yet, but if you're interested you can reach out to Professor Notestein (j-notestein@northwestern.edu) 

And he didn't say this specifically, but I know he's wishing all of you the best of luck on finals! (As am I!)

Enjoy spring break and I'll see you all next quarter,

Natalie Kennelley
AIChE Northwestern Co-President
