Hey y'all,

So as some of you may have seen already on the book of Faces, we will be having a SHAPE presentation regarding the "hooking up" culture and different tips and cautions for hooking up. It'll take place in the 1st floor main lounge at 7pm this Wednesday. They even asked us to bring a table so we can do a fun activity and there may or may not be sweets involved :D 

I hope to see you all on Wednesday!'
Hali and amazing fellow CAs
