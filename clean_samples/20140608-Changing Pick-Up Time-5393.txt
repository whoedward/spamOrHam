Hi,

I am trying to change my pick-up time (due to server errors it was changed), but it seems that I cannot do so. The advice on the FAQ section of the site told me to go to the "Schedule Pick-Up" section and to change my information there; however, when i go to this portion of the site, there are no buttons nor any links that I can click to adjust my pick-up time. Please let me know what I can do to fix this.
