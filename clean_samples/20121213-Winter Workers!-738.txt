Greetings NTS!
 
'Tis the season for stressing, vegging, and then making up for it later. 
 
I know some of you (including myself) will be happy just to get away from campus, but for those of you remaining in the area that need to make an extra buck, lay some times and dates on me for next week? 
 
This (not) very intensive labor will probably be project oriented, so raise your hand for productive cash in the making!
 
Happy Holidays, Every One!
 
Marina W.
