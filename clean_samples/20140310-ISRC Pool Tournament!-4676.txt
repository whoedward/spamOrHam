Hey ISRC,

Join us tomorrow, March 11, at 8pm for an ISRC pool tournament, to celebrate and break in the new table and gear! We'll be playing 8-ball in teams of two. The format of the tournament will be some type of round-robin, but will vary somewhat depending on how many teams sign up. Entrance in the tournament is free, but the winners will receive a $25 Naf Naf Grill gift card! Hope to see you there!

Peace, love, and little donuts,
Will
