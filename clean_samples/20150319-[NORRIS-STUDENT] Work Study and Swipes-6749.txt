Attention Norris Work Study Employees,


 We’d like to use this as an opportunity to remind everyone that accurate time reporting is a condition of your employment at Norris and Northwestern, and manipulating your hours for personal gain is no different than stealing from the university and from the federal work study program.  Work study funding is not an entitlement, and while allocated in your name, it is not yours until you have earned it.

 

With that in mind, please be aware of the following job requirements:


·         Clock in at the beginning of your shift, and out again at the end.  With exception to any time your direct supervisor allots (IE; five minutes before or after your shift.

·         Only clock in and out for shifts to which you have been assigned.

·         If there is a problem with the time clock, please notify your full-time supervisor.

·         You are responsible for checking your time-sheets on Kronos every pay period, and you should notify your full-time supervisor of any errors.

·         If you do not report any errors, your silence is verification that you have in fact worked all reported hours.

·                    

·          If anyone feels they may have knowingly or unknowingly misreported hours, we are giving you the opportunity to come forth and report those errors now with out serious repercussions.   Please notify your supervisor of any necessary changes by APRIL 6th, 2015.   If the errors resulted in personal gain, you will be asked to pay that money back to the university, or it will be deducted from future payroll.



Regards,
