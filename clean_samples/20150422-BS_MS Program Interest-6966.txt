Hello Dr. Trajcevski,

My name is Ethan Robison. I am a junior in the computer science program through McCormick. I spoke recently with Bruce Lindall about involvement in the BS/MS program, and he suggested that I reach out to you to about what I would need to do. 

With that in mind, if you have any availablity in the near future, I'd like to schedule an appointment with you to discuss what I can do concerning getting started with the program as early as possible. 

Please let me know if you need any more information from me. Thank you in advance for your time.

Best,

--
