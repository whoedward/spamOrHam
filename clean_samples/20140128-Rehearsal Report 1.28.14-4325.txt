Rehearsal Notes:

    We got through almost the entirety of our cue to cue during rehearsal, which was very relieving! Extra programming of only a few cues was done after our prod meeting.
    The actors were very patient and focused for the most part. Gus, Jason, Josh, Maia and I were collaborative and able to solve most problems during the cue to cue.

Scenery Notes:

    See Matt’s forthcoming email for things that can be done during the day tomorrow.
    Painting of platforms and barriers has been mostly done
    Hanging and unfurling of banners was figured out—we’ll discuss with the actors tomorrow before the run
    A few more painting things need to be finished

Prop Notes:

    Walls look awesome!
    We’ll also be painting the third Shanley pole tomorrow night

Costume Notes:

    Armbands are done!
    Ironing party will be happening sometime in the nexttwo days—stay tuned for information about that in Matt’s email
    Almost everything has been resolved!

Light Notes:

    Thank you for all your hard work, Jason and Gus!

Sound Notes:

    Thank you, Josh!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    Chairs need to be put up—hopefully tomorrow, L&M will be contacted about it.
