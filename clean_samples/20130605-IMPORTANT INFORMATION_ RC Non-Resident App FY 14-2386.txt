Hi everyone!


The non-resident membership application for 2013-2014 is now available.  The application will be available until June 12.  If you have any questions, go to the Residential College Board office Monday-Friday between the hours of 8:30am and 4:00pm; the office is on the first floor of Scott Hall. Iâ€™ve attached the application and it is also available on the RCB website.

Mary Dworak in the RCB office will accept applications until June 12 to give each exec board time to approve the applicants prior to leaving campus for the summer. 
Applications CANNOT be accepted over the summer (July-August), but RCB will repost the application for the academic year in September.

Keys will be available beginning the first week of classes.

ISRCLove,

Nathan
