Hey Alex,

I am sorry that I missed my shift. I was busy with my roommate and missed my shift. By the time that I realized, it was too late. I should have gotten in touch with you.

Regards,
Ethan

    Ethan,
    Yesterday evening you did not show up for your 8PM-10PM shift.  Please let the supervisors know why you were not present as soon as possible. 

    Alex
