Hey everyone,

There will not be any practice on May 27th, which is next Monday because that's Memorial Day.

There are no classes that day either. Everyone gets the day off, so instead of practice, I'm going to host a pizza/movie party at my apartment. You're all invited, and we're all going to watch Undisputed 2 and 3. Chances are you've never seen these movies before, which I believe is a real tragedy because these they are awesome.

RVSP so I know how much food to get and stuff. These movies are SO GOOD.

My address is 1930 Ridge Avenue Apt. C307. That's the apartment complex at the end of Foster street. Call me so I can let you in (phone #: 803-237-1607). Monday. 7 PM. BE THERE.

Ji-hoon

PS I'm including a short 2 minute clip from the third film to whet your appetite. Resist the urge to watch any more than this until Monday.
