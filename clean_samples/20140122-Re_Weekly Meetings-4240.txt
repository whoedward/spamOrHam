Sorry about that! Me and Harlynn were moving some chairs from the hollow to our apartment and it took longer than expected.

    Hi Kara,

    This is just a reminder concerning the weekly meetings on Wednesday nights. They are mandatory, and missing one does count as missing a shift. With that said, this email serves as your official notification as to that fact.

    In the future, please be sure to attend the meetings or make certain to let us know why it is that you are missing them by midnight the night before at the latest.

    If there was an emergency this week (1/22/14), please email me or NTSsupervisors@gmail.com and let us know. If you have any questions, please let us know.

    Regards,
    Ethan
