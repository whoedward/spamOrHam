Hey all!

First off, I'm really excited to be working with all of you on the website. I feel like there is a lot of potential here. We are dividing tasks into 5 main groups, so here is a recap of what we talked about during the meeting, as well as our goal for next week:

Kelly and Rachel

    Consolidate links from the McCormick main website.
    Let's try to do most of the heavy lifting this weekend and have that page done by next Thursday.

Ethan

    The issue of advising.
    I need to clarify what that entails.

Alisa

    Events calendar. It would be good to research the easiest way for student groups to do this. I am sending an email to the student group leaders' listserv.
    In the meanwhile, let's have something up to be able to demo by the time the next student leaders' luncheon rolls around.

Gregory

    Digitize the grant application form.
    Should be able to finish by next Thursday, with exception of a few particular features.

Don't forget, we're meeting in Mudd Library Saturday at 10 AM! I've reserved Room 227 until 11:30 AM (in case we go a little over). See you there!
