Hi,

Kara and I just finished our sweep of the building tonight.  There was an add-on in McCormick that the sheets said used 2 microphones and a mac adapter.  I found 1 of the microphones behind the stage with what looked like costumes for the group reserving McCormick but could not find the other microphone or the mac adapter.
