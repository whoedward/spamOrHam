Get ready for
CRC Radiothon 2012
Dec. 3-5

Radiothon is an annual CRC charity event that raises money for the American Heart Association and the CRC Equipement Fund. It's a 50-hour, continuous radio show broadcast live from CRC's own Radio Room and consists of money-raising shows pitched and planned entirely by CRC residents. Radiothon started in memory of Will Arnold, a CRC Equipment Chair who passed away in his room due to a cardiac arrhythmia during a fire drill. We're very excited this year to celebrate the 25th Annual Radiothon, and we're trying hard to celebrate this milestone and continue to honor Will's memory by raising a lot of money for the hearts.

This year, Radiothon will start at 10pm on Monday, Dec. 3 (Reading Week) and will run continuously until midnight the following Wednesday. If you'd like to help out, or just listen in to the shenanigans, our final schedule will be on our website crcradiothon2012.tumblr.com and our live stream will be up on mixlr.com/crcradiothon. And if you feel like calling in to the shows, you can reach the CRC Radio Room at (847) 467-6464.
