Hey everyone,

We're ready to begin the competition! So here's what you need to know:

1) Each suite has $25 to spend on decorations. If you aren't sure how reimbursement works, ask any exec members or our treasurer Victor. I have construction paper, so come by my room if you'd like some.

2) When taping decorations to the walls and/or ceiling, you have to use specific painter's tape or else the decorations will be torn down. The CAs should have this tape, and we might go pick some up later too.

3) You have until Tuesday October 15th to finish decorating your suites. The master staff will be around at 4pm this day to walk around checking out your suites. Have at least someone from each suite present to explain your decorations to the master staff.

4) The winning suites will get more money to spend on munchies!

5) DISCLAIMER: Be mindful and aware of your decoration choices. If you have to question yourselves whether your decorations could be an issue, it's best not to follow through with it.

Alrighty. If I forgot anything, fellow exec members, feel free to add more info to this e-mail.

May the best suite win (we all know Mother Russia will win in the end, but I'm just being polite)! :D

Thomas
