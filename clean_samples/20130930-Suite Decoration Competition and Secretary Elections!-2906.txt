Hey everyone,

Remember to e-mail me your decisions for suite countries by Wednesday.

Also, I have secretary petitions on my door. Follow the directions and hand completed forms to me or slide them under my door by next open exec on Sunday. Ask any exec members for info on secretary duties.

Thanks!
Thomas
