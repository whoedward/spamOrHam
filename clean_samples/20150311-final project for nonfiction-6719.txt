So I have to pick one of these to develop for my final project. I wrote "Intention" last summer and it's pretty much a complete piece, although it could be reworked a bit. "Pounds" is still very much in the beginning stages, and I was thinking I could do something interesting with it in terms of formatting, like including pictures of me growing up or something.
