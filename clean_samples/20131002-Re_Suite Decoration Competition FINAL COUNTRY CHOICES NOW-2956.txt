    Hey everyone,

    Ok, we're almost ready to start the competition. HOWEVER, I need to hear from 1-blue and 3-mocha (rust). Tell me your countries by tomorrow at 9am or else we will decide your countries for you.

    Also, 2-red is now officially Lebanon. I just want to confirm this.

    Thanks!
    Thomas
