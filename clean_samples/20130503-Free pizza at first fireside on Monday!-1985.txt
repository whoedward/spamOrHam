Hi everyone,
There will be a fireside in the main lounge on Monday, May 6th at 7pm! 

Indira Johnson will be speaking to us about her experiences with the Ten Thousand Ripples project. She is an artist and non-violence educator originally from India who works in Chicago as a sculptor, peace activist, cultural worker, and educator.

Here is her website if you're interested http://www.indirajohnson.com/Indira_Johnson/Home.html

Come check it out.
There will be free pizza and drinks sponsored by NU Interfaith Advocates.

Monday at 7, see you all there :)
