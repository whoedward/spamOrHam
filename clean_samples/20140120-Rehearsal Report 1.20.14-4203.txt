Rehearsal Notes:

    We did all the filming for our promo video today! Immense thanks to Jackson and his crew, Erin and John, for all their help. Thank you to Matt, who also came to help and supervise!
    We were able to use the Struble in TI, which was great. It was awesome to have all that space to play with, and the black box setting was perfect for the lighting that Jackson wanted. While there was a lot of sitting around at the beginning during setup time, we were able to get all the shots we needed in under the four hour period. Many of the actors were able to leave early as well, so only a few had to stick around for the full filming period.
    It was certainly hard from a stage management standpoint to have the actors waiting around for the majority of the rehearsal time. But such is the nature of shooting a promo video. Jackson did a great job, and communicated well with me, Matt and Maia. When the actors were eventually used for their shots, the crew worked quickly and efficiently. All in all, it was a little unnerving but successful!

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    Thank you, Justin, for delivering the props today! We’ll be in contact about getting them from you again on Thursday.

Costume Notes:

    I am in the process of compiling a list and/or spreadsheet with all the actors’ info about who has what. You can expect that via email sometime in the next 24 hours.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    There was some talk today about you recording certain important lines for the promo video, because there was no sound recorded today. Would you be able to do that when you come in to rehearsal on Thursday?

Blood Notes:

    We saw the blood demos on Matt’s phone—THEY LOOK AWESOME. So excited!

Miscellaneous Notes:

    We will hopefully be doing another full run through on Thursday. Anyone who wants to come see is welcome; in fact, we already have several team members coming to view it, and we encourage you to come!
