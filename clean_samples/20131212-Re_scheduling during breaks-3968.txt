Hey Michael,

I got a message from Alex saying that he would be late (he caught the wrong shuttle). I passed the memo along to Juan (who took Will's shift), but received no response from him.

I will email both of them about it. If there is any other confusion, please let me know.

Sorry about the confusion,
Ethan

    Hey folks,

    We need to make sure schedules are accurate on Shiftplanning for breaks.  We had no techs on duty from 2-4 today yet Alex and Will were on the schedule.  I don’t want to enter a work week where I don’t know if anyone is on shift.  I hold all of you accountable for the schedule.  So if it is not accurate then that is a poor reflection of your duties.

     

    Also a reminder, Norris is open during and after finals.  Employees of Norris do not get to check out when they feel like it, they need to request the time off.  Requests for time off will be granted by supervisors.  Please remember this is a job, a job that understands you are students and have crazy schedules, but a job nonetheless. 

     

    Happy winter break.

     

    Michael
