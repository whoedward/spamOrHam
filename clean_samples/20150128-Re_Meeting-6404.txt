Hey Juan,
We can try to get you those shifts, but we're going to have to count this as an unexcused absence since we gave you more than a week's notice. 

Thanks,
NTS Supers

    Hey,

    I'm sorry this is so late but something came up. A meeting that I was supposed to go to got moved to 7. If at all possible, I'd love to take the saturday close or any saturday shifts after 2 pm that I don't already have.

    All the best,
    Juan
