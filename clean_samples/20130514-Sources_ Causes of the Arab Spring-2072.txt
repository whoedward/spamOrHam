Hello Professor,

Here are some links to useful articles/pages concerning the Arab Spring. However, I am not sure if these are "political scienc-y" enough to be helpful. It has been difficult because most people want to report on what is happening in the Arabian countries and not why it happened.

I also feel that many of them are simply journalism articles. Could you recommend for me any better political science sources? Should I be considering literature? If so, I have a few resources that I know of that might be useful in considering the Middle East conflict, as this was a topic that we studied in high school.

These five are more useful:

These few are good analysis of the current situation:

And, finally, there are a few books:

The Arab-Israeli Conflict, by Kristen Schulze

A Peace to End All Peace, by David Fromkin

These two provide excellent background on the situation, and the first offers some details on the Arab Spring.



I do not know if this is anywhere along the lines of useful, so I hope that I have given you enough information to understand where I am in terms of understanding the project.

Thank you very much for your patience,
Ethan
