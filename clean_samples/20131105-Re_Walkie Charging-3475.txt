        Hey Max,

        This morning when I came in both walkies were nearly dead in the charger.
        Bobby told me that you were the one to put them up.
        You are not in trouble, but please try to make sure that the light is a solid red when you put the walkies up. It's a big hastle to only have one walkie, and even more annoying to have neither.

        Best,
        Ethan
