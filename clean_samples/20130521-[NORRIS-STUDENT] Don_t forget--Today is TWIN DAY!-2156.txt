A big congratulations to yesterday's winners--Helix Gartner from Housestaff and Marie Peeples from the Box Office! I'll make sure your meal tickets get to you.

Here's a reminder for the rest of the week, keep the submissions coming!

TODAY--TUESDAY 5/21: TWIN DAY: Grab your favorite Norris pal, and dress alike. Accessorize. Pose for your picture with matching skinny arms. If that's not your style, perfect a matching mean mug for your photo. Creativity is appreciated. Each member of the winning two pairs will receive a meal ticket for this day.

WEDNESDAY 5/22: CELEBRITY DOPPELGÄNGER DAY: Dress up like a celeb you remotely resemble (yes, Dan Foley counts, although I'm not sure how many students on staff could pull off a doppelgänger look). With your pic, send in a comparison pic of the celebrity, or just write a note mentioning who you're imitating, for clarity, just in case.

THURSDAY 5/23: NERD DAY: Maybe this is the true northwestern spirit day. Maybe this is your true style. Maybe this one is your biggest stretch. I believe in your talents. Embrace your inner Pokemon enthusiast, put on your pocket protector, break out the Star Trek gear, or your old head gear. 

FRIDAY 5/24: NU SPIRIT DAY: All purple everything. 

FRIDAY 5/24 at 8pm: NORRIS PROM! More prizes! Food! Dancing! More costumes!! All your Norris pals, having a good time. Be sure to rock your finest thrifted formalwear, or just whatever you've got.
