    Hey folks,

    I donâ€™t know if I told you but the report that creates the AV board had a glitch and I had to create a new one from scratch.  In doing so I inadvertently left out extra technican hours here at Norris.  That being said we need one extra tech Saturday from 6-8 to help set up Large PA.

     

    Can one of you jump on it? 

     

    Thanks,
