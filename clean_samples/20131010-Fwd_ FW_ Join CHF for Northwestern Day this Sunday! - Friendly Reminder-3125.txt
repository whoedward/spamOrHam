--Steve Ross of Lincoln Park Zoo.

Discounted Tickets to Lookingglass Theatre for Friends of CHF

Lookingglass is pleased to offer $34 tickets to weekday performances of the world premiere adaptation of Marguerite Duras' novel THE NORTH CHINA LOVER, now playing through Nov. 10. A steamy affair in the seamy French Quarter of 1930s Southern Indochina between an impoverished schoolgirl and a wealthy 27-year-old Chinese aristocrat transports us on a provocative and haunting journey of awakening and sacrifice. Intended for mature audiences.

 

Call 312-337-0665 or buy online at lookingglasstheatre.org and use discount code "DURAS34." Valid for performances Tuesday-Friday, through Oct. 31. Subject to availability, not valid on previously purchased tickets.
