Hi guys,

In case you didn't see the Facebook post, there will be a pair of IT guys who are testing the wifi and asking questions so we can get better internet. So don't be alarmed if you come back to the dorm and find them in your rooms, they are just testing the connections. Sorry for the inconvenience, I just found out about this today.

-Eric
