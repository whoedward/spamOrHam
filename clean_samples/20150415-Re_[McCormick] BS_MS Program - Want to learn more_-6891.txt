    Hello Mr. Lindall,

    My name is Ethan Robison, I am a computer science junior in McCormick, and I am interested in the BS/MS program. I'm not sure as to what specifically I need to do to get started, but I would love to get started as soon as possible.

    Please let me know what I can do to make progress!

    Best,
    Ethan Robison

    McCormick Juniors:

     

    Greetings to you as you are winding up your junior year!

     

    Many of you have heard about the BS/MS program from other McCormick students.  Would you like to learn more?

     

    Here are some important points:

     

    ·         First of all you need to have at least a 3.00 GPA to be considered for BS/MS admission.

     

    ·         Anyone with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or higher will receive automatic admission.  Those between 3.00 and 3.49 are considered individually for admission by the MS department.

     

    ·         You can apply for the program during the quarter in which you will wind up within four courses of completing your BS degree requirements.

     

    ·         If you are a junior and will finish this quarter with no more than four courses left to complete the BS degree requirements, then you should be talking to us about applying for admission before you leave for the summer. 

     

    ·         The BS/MS application is a short application process, requires no application fee, and you do not need to take the GRE.  What a deal!

     

    ·         You can even tell your friends in Weinberg about this.  Weinberg undergraduates are eligible for the BA/MS program and can complete the MS in McCormick!

     

    ·         All it takes is an e-mail to set up an appointment to learn more.  It is never too early to plan for admission to the BS/MS Program.

     

    ·         When you are admitted to the BS/MS Programs, you have several options:

     

    o    Advanced students have the strong possibility of completing both the BS and MS degrees in four years.

    o    Other students who complete the BS degree and not the MS degree simultaneously have three options:

    §  Return in the fall after completing the BS degree and remain here until you complete the MS degree.

    §  Leave and work for a while, returning within five years to finish the MS degree.

    §  Leave with the BS degree and never complete the MS degree.  No BS/MS student is ever obligated to complete the MS degree.

     

    So…what are you waiting for?  Please e-mail me so we can have this very important conversation about the BS/MS Program, or perhaps an additional conversation about PhD admission anywhere in the United States.

     

    Best regards.

     

    Bruce
