Hi All,

We will be having a meeting tonight at 8PM in the blue suite (outside my room) where I will be going over closing procedures before Winter Break. It will be a very short meeting (5-10 minutes) so please try to come as I will be going over some important information and I don't anyone to get charged or written up for not following the procedures. On another note, anyone who has not given me their RCIs yet must fill it out and slide it under my door before they leave for break as we will be checking room conditions by the end of next week. If you can no longer find your RCIs, come find me and I will give you a new one. I hope that everyone is having a good reading week. Good luck studying for your finals!!

Best,
Danny
