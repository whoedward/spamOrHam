International Dinner is on Sunday, February 24th. For those of you who still don't know what that is, it is an ISRC tradition, and our annual formal. There will be a talent show, music, tons of food and more!
Instead of buying a ticket, you make an international dish (that serves 10) by yourself or with a friend! We don't want you to spend any money on it, so TODAY I need you to send me your dish name, partner and your recipe and I'll buy the ingredients and give them to you.
If you want to go and do NOT give me your recipe in time, then you will have to buy the ingredients yourself and you will NOT be reimbursed.
