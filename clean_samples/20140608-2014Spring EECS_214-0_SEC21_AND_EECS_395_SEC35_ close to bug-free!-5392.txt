Hey guys!

Here is a working link to our project (thanks to zhaoyang):

http://juliett-nu.herokuapp.com/

I've been debugging it for the last few days.  I think I have gotten most of the bugs out, but it still crashes at times.  I'm working to fix all of the little bugs left.  Play around with it and see if you can get it to crash, and if it does crash a lot, email me back with what courses you are passing it and I'll fix the code.

But, for the most part, we are done! (sigh of relief)  I'll send out an email with everything I am going to submit about a day before I actually submit the thing so everyone can respond with their opinions.  The submitted materials will be all the front end code, the back end code, the back end javadoc, and a report about the entire project.

Also, maybe we can add pictures to the GUI (like the lakefill background we had before.)  If anyone wants to add some, feel free.

Jeremy

P.S. Should we leave the line about CAESAR being a "hellhole"?  We can take a group vote.
