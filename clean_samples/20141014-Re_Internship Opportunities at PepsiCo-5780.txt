Hello Mr. Dennis,

Thank you very much for contacting me! I have looked into Pepsico's McCormickConnect profile, and am interested to learn more about the company. Specifically, I am eager to learn more about any intership or Co-op programs that PepsiCo might have available. I will be in attendance at the SWE Industry Day this Thursday and will certainly seek out PepsiCo's booth.

Concerning my GPA: I have a 3.11 overall, and a 3.14 within my major.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide for you.

I look forward to talking with you again.

Best,

Ethan Robison

    Good afternoon Ethan!

    The PepsiCo Recruiting Team has reviewed your resume and would be interested to discuss our open Internship opportunities with you at the upcoming SWE Industry Day event on Thursday, October 16th.

    Please review our job posting on McCormickConnect and if you feel you may be interested in one or more of the types of roles we recruit for, please come by to see us at our booth on Thursday so we can discuss your background and our roles in greater detail.  Also, in the interim, could you please respond back with your GPA, both overall and within your major?

    If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out; also, if you will not be attending the SWE Industry Day event this week, let us know and we can make other arrangements to discuss.

    Thank you very much for your consideration!
