Hi,

Today, Events Planning called the techs on shift (Alex Z and Alex L) around 4:30ish and asked them to go the Great Room and set up a projector and screen for an event that was starting around 5pm. I double-checked the sheets and AV Board from the past few weeks and there was nothing indicating any events that were going on today.

I rushed up there to help set up, and the event started without too much delay, but we were completely caught off guard and had to scramble to get the event ready. What I found frustrating was the fact that the event was supposedly scheduled for weeks but we only found out about the AV request right before the event was supposed to start. If there were more events going on in Norris, more equipment was requested, or we couldn't get a super to help out, we probably would not have been able get the event setup properly.

In the future, is it possible to get more heads up about these events? We can get them covered easily at the meeting, or even with a few day's notice but this one cut it way too close. In addition, are we moving forward with plans to keep equipment or give away responsibility to Satellite venues?

Thanks,

Alex Yang
