Hey y'all,

Here is the link for the points for this spring quarter:

Even though you may think you have no reason to get points for this quarter since it is spring, there may or may not be PRIZES depending on how many points you get this quarter. Just a little tidbit of info for ya. :)

Regards,

Thomas
