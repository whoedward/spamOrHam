Happy Friday Everyone!

Next Wednesday (October 1st)  at 4 p.m. we are going to be hosting a small taste testing session to get student and faculty input on a re-envisioned Pasta/Wok Station down on the Ground Floor. You will be tasting new menu options and asked to give feedback on them.

Since this is a small event, only the first 8 people who respond to this email will be able to attend so if you think you would be interested let me know ASAP.

Always,
~Carmen M.
