    I have class until 5 that day at Frances Searle, so I would not be able to cover the whole shift unless it is absolutely necessary.

            Hey All,

            The group in the Louis North room on Wednesday, the second of October would like to hire an extra technician. Equipment will be just a laptop and a microphone. It is worth noting that this will be considering an out of house event, so whoever takes can swipe in for off-site pay.

            Best,
            Ethan
