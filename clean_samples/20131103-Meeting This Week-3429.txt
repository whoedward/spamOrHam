Hey fellow supers, 

I'm not going to be able to make it to the meeting this week I don't think because I have a meeting regarding student teaching I have to do for next year. Also, Michael wanted someone to be updating shiftplanning at the meeting while we get shifts covered and such. I volunteered to do that from now on, but if someone could go ahead and do that for this week's meeting in my absence that would be great. Thanks everyone!
