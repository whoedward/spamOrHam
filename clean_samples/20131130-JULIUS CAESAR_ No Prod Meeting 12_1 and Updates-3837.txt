Hi everyone!

I hope y'all had a nice Thanksgiving and are enjoying the last bit of the mini-break. After giving it some thought, I decided to cancel tomorrow's prod meeting and make our last meeting before winter break next Sunday (12/8). I figured it would make sense to hold off because last week was split by break and many of you might not have updates on account of the holiday. I do realize next Sunday is the night before finals week and some people might want to keep this an early night. Please fill out this Doodle with the evening times you are free... if enough people are free at an earlier time then we can switch. 

Because we are not meeting, here are some important notes:

1) FUNDRAISERS THIS WEEK: This is a huge fundraising/publicity/outreach for us and we need everyone's support! Here's what's going on:

    All day Tuesday: Jamba Juice Fundraiser! Just say "Julius Caesar" at the register and some of your purchase will go toward the show. Tell everyone and get a group of friends together to go get smoothies!
    Tuesday/Saturday, 9 am - 4 pm: Barnes and Noble gift-wrapping! We will be running the gift-wrap table, talking to Evanstonians about the show and soliciting donations. We already have a bunch of people signed up, but there are still some slots open. Sign up HERE!
    Wednesday @ 9 pm: CAESAR Roast in Fisk 217! Tell everyone you know that it will be hilarious and there will be free food! Everyone on the team should come and try to bring at least one friend!

2) DESIGNER MEETINGS THIS WEEK: Maia and I would like to meet with lead designers individually this week, just to touch base one-on-one before break. We have set aside some time on Tuesday and Friday for these meetings. LEAD DESIGNERS: please choose a time slot for your individual meeting! Assistants/anyone else are welcome at these meetings if you are available! 

3) BUDGETS: I am in the process of finalizing budgets for the show and am just waiting on a couple more pieces of information. Lead designers: stay tuned for emails with your budget and budget tracker spreadsheets, coming very soon.

Phew, I think that's it. As always, email me with questions/concerns or cries of outrage! Thanks everyone for all of your hard work!

All the best,
Matt
