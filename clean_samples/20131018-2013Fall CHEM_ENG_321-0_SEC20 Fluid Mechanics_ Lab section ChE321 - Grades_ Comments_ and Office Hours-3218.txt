Dear Class,

I wanted to let you all know that grades for Lab 1 have now been entered into Blackboard.  You should have received your report back in class today.  Please let me know ASAP if the grade on your paper does not match the grade on Blackboard, so I can make sure I did not enter any of the grades incorrectly.

In addition to Professor Burghardt's comments in class today regarding the report, I wanted to add a few additional point of feedback that applied to many of your reports:

1)  Please be sure that when you include an equation in the body of your report that you define all variables (yes, including density and gravity) and that these variables are always listed in italics.  This is standard in scientific papers.  You need only define each one once in the paper the first time you use it.

2)  The report guidelines require you to include 2 appendices, which include raw data (yes, in the units in which you measured it) and sample calculations.  If you do not includes these appendices, you lose points in multiple areas in which you are being evaluated.

3) Please staple multiple page reports.  I will not sympathize with you if you turn it in unstapled and pages go missing.

If you have any questions about the grading of your report, please come see me during my office hours or schedule a meeting with me separately.  My office hours this upcoming week are:

Monday, October 21, 3 - 4 pm in E225

Tuesday, October 22, 9 - 10 am in E225

I will answer brief questions through email over the weekend as well.  Remember that Lab 3 is taking place on Friday a week from today.

Thanks,

Erica
