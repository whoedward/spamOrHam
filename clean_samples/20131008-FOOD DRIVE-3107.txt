Hello, lovely ISRCers!

GUESS WHAT?! SOMEONE DONATED FIVE CANS TO THE FOOD DRIVE!!!!!! THAT'S AWESOME!!!! (FYI, the Food Drive in is conjunction with the Zombie Walk, so it runs until Oct. 25, the date of the Zombie Walk. Donate to the BOX IN THE MAIN LOUNGE!!!!) Anyway, the only problem is I don't know who donated the cans! Please email me your donation whenever you happen to make one - name, suite, and what you donated. If you don't, I can't give you or your team points. :( Also, new rule: The winning team has to get at least 20 points in order to win the $50. Hopefully this will simultaneously encourage more donations and more communication among teams. :) Thanks, guys! Feel free to talk to me about questions, comments, suggestions, etc related to philanthropy stuff!

ISRClove,
Ayla
