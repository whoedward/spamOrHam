Hey guys,

My internship needs me to stay later tomorrow night, but I'm also scheduled for the Saturday night rotation. I was hoping someone might be available to cover it? Obviously it's not the most ideal shift to cover, so I'm more than willing to switch with someone else, or even one of the rotations tonight.

I'd really appreciate it!
