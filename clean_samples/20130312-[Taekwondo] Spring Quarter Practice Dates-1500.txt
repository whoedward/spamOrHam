Hey everyone,

Most of you already know that the belt test is tomorrow at Blom, but I thought I should also announce to everyone when practices resume for Spring quarter.

Next week is finals week. Then, it's Spring break. After that, we have practices again, which is about three weeks.

So we'll resume practices on Wednesday, April 3rd. (We would resume on Monday, but Blomquist is still closed for Spring Break on that Monday). Good luck on the belt test, and good luck with finals!

Ji-hoon
