Hi Everyone, 

Welcome back to Norris Tech Services! I'm writing because we need all of your schedules and availability ASAP. Please fill out the class schedule spreadsheet for fall quarter as soon as possible. Also, we need people to work shifts starting this week. Please email the supervisors if you are available to work at any time before classes start and we can set you up with some hours. We could definitely use the help.
