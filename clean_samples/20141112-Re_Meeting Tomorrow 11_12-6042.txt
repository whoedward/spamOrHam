Hey Hannah,

There isn't much on the AV Board this week.  There is only an extra tech needed Sunday 6-11PM, and an equipment delivery Wednesday.  This means setting up a projector and screen at 5PM and someone tearing it down at 8PM.

Thanks for taking Will's shift!

    Hannah,

    You're excused from the meeting. Can you go ahead and take Will's request on ShiftPlanning? You can accept it under the Requests > Shift Trades > Accept buttons on ShiftPlanning.
