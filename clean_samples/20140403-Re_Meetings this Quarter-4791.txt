Hey Ethan, 

I’m sorry for the trouble! I will try my best to split my attendance between the two meetings. Just a heads up for next week, I will be in chicago for a volunteering event and won’t be able to make it to the meeting. As for the weeks after, I will alternate between attending meetings. One last note, since the show is scheduled on 5/11 and things get quite hectic two weeks before that, I most likely won’t be able to make it to meetings on 4/30 and 5/7. After the show is over, I will commit most of my time wednesday 7 clocks to NTS meetings! :)

Thank you,

Angela

We'd like you to split your attendance between the two, if you would kindly. Because meetings are when most of the scheduling gets done, this will make it easier for you and for us to make sure that things are taken care of.
