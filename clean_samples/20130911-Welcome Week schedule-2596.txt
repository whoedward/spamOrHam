Hey supervisors,

I just wanted to let you know, that I won't be able to work at all during Welcome Week. I'll be able to start working on Tuesday Sept 24. I'll be a Peer Adviser this year, so I have to commit all of my time during Wildcat Welcome up until that point. I also noted it on the scheduling spreadsheet.  If I do have a shift during that time, I'll just try to get it covered.  Sorry for any inconveniences, and let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks!

Magan
