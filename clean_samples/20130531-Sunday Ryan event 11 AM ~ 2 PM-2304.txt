Hey guys,

I realized that I don't have too much left of my work-study allowance because I've been taking everyone's shifts lately... haha
So can someone take this three hour shift this Sunday? 
It's 11 AM... it's possible to wake up a little before 11, even after dillo..

If no one wants it, I guess I can still do it.. but I'd appreciate it if someone takes this.

Thanks~
