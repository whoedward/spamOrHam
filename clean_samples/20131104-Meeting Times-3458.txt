Hello Professor,

I am emailing regarding Winter Scheduling Meetings. Times that work for me (this week) are:
Tuesday 11-2 and 3-5
Thursday 11-5
Friday 11-2 and 3-5
Please let me know if any of these work for you! If there is anything else that I can help you with, do not hesitate to say so.

Best,
Ethan Robison
