IM Info!! I tell no lies!!

Alright y'all it's Paul Kim, your IM Chair from last quarter. After a very successful Winter Quarter, IM is resuming this quarter with the following three sports:

Softball
Soccer
Ultimate Frisbee 

By following the link below you will find a Google form where you can fill out the times that you are available to play. You don't need to do all three sports! In fact, you don't have to do any! But I highly encourage you to participate, even if you've never played/aren't very good, because chances are you'll have a lot of fun and meet new people anyway!

Please fill this out by 11:59:59 PM, April 3rd (I know, it's short notice.. it's not my fault!! don't shoot the messenger!!)

Be involved with our LAST QUARTER OF IM THIS YEAR!!!

Thanks a bunch
Keep it trill
