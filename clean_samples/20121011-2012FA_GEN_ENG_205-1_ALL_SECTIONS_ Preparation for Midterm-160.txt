Hi EA1 Students,
As you're probably realizing, the first midterm is coming up fast (next Thursday). To help you prepare, we have posted some supplementary material. In the "Documents" folder, there are two new folders. One of them contains helpful (but not necessarily comprehensive) lecture slides from Section 23. The other contains a sample midterm, along with solutions, for your practice.

As far as the midterm itself, you are responsible for all material up to the week of the midterm, including material on the homework due on the day of the midterm. You are not responsible for material covered during the week of the midterm, starting next Monday.

Good luck preparing, and let me know if you have any questions.

-Ilya Mikhelson
