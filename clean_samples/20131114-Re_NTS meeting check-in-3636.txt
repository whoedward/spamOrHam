Hey Bobby,

Thanks for checking in with me about this. The conflict is going to be permanent, the business meeting I have on Wednesday occurs weekly, and I will be in the business for the foreseeable future.

Something can definitely be arranged as far as attending NTS meetings, I understand the importance of being there as part of the job. I'll get in touch with people and figure it out. Once a month seems like it'd be a reasonable compromise. Thanks again for checking in with me, I appreciate the reaching out. I'll get back to you on this before next week's meeting.

Best,
Jake Degler

    Hi Jake,

    We really appreciate you consistently checking in with us about missing meetings due to your other business conflicts. We supers were wondering how long of a conflict this will be though.

    The meetings are required as a part of the position and we've been checking in with everyone to make sure that we have as much participation as possible to get shifts covered. 

    If this is a conflict recurring indefinitely, we were hoping to negotiate a comprise such as arranging to attend the NTS meetings at least once a month. Please let us know what your commitments will look like going forward and how we can help you meet the requirements for both positions. 

    Thanks,
    Bobby Ramirez
