Dear ISRC, 

The Exec Board will begin packing up communal items in ISRC this week as we prepare for summer vacation. 

Important Deadlines: ALL personal items must be removed from the kitchens, main lounge, and basement by WEDNESDAY, 6/11. Anything left will be thrown in with the other ISRC owned items. 

If you have any questions please see me or Rohan. 

As everyone prepares for finals week I just want to tell you all that this has been an amazing year. I hope you all have enjoyed living in ISRC. To those of you who are leaving, we are sad to see you go, and hope you strongly consider non-resing.  And for those of you who ARE returning, I look forward to another year together! 

Best of luck on your finals. I believe in all of you, and wish you all the best of luck! 

If I don't get to see you in person, have a GREAT summer!!! 

ISRCLove, 

Esteban
