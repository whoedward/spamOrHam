Juan,

I thought you had the office key and returned it? I never had possession of the key last night.

    Hi Juan and Irene,

    Opening the building this morning, Michael discovered that the tech services office key was left inside the doorknob rather than being returned to the info desk. According to ShiftPlanning, you two were last night's closing techs.

    It is the responsibility of the closing techs on shift to return the office key to the info desk after locking up your key rings. Considering the issues we have had with missing keys recently, it is extremely important that this be followed. 

    Please consider this a a warning and reminder for next time.
