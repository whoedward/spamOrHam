Hey Guys,

Academic and Fellow Committee Meeting will start at 8PM tonight in the Main Lounge. 

Since I will be going for Cross RC trip on Friday evening, IFN for this week will be on Saturday night. We will be watching a Korean crime thriller, "The Man from Nowhere" (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_from_nowhere_2010/), starring actor Won Bin. Released in 2010,  the movie immediately became a blockbuster in Korea, and it has also won various awards. So, come and enjoy the movie on Saturday night at 8PM in the basement !

See you then,
Arkar
