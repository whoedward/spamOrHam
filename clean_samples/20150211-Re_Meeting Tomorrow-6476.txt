Hi everybody,

I'm really sorry but I have dinner plans tonight and there is a chance that I won't be able to make it back before the meeting. But I don't have any shifts that I need to release. Please contact me at 630-885-6698 if you would need to ask me about shift coverages.

Thanks,

Sandy Cheung
