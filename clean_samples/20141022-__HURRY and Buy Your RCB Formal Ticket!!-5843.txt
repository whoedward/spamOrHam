Hi ISRC,

We currently have 7 tickets left for the RCB formal. If you want to go, please get your money in asap. Once we sell the last tickets, I'll put people on a wait list. 

I am currently in the lounge of 2-Blue if you want to buy your ticket now (I have change), OR you can put your money in an envelope and slide it under my door (room 223) later. 

Best,
Esteban
