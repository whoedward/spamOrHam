> This sounds great.  You can actually meet us at Brian’s appointment the 12th floor of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (345 E. Superior Street).  If you come a few minutes early then I can meet you in the 12th floor lobby (just have the front desk page me overhead) and bring you into the back.  We will do our treatment session for about 40-45 minutes and then you can have some time to meet and chat with Brian.  I can actually meet with you at 2:45pm over my lunch break since it is my late day to work.  Can you stay to meet with me at 2:45pm?

In the next week we have a few appointments and we thought you could observe our treatment and then meet with us either before or after for additional questions.  Please check out the times below and let us know if one of these times work for you.  Brian may have more time to meet and discuss with you but I will likely have other patients to see.

We are very excited to get started, and hope we can begin by observing a therapy session with Brian so that we can better understand his injury, any medical apparatuses currently in place, and the best way to assist him further. In addition to observing a therapy session, we would like to interview Brian, yourself, and any other therapists to help us obtain information from a variety of viewpoints.
