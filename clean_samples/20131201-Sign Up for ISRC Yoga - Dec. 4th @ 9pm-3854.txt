Hello ISRC,

I write to remind you of your ISRC-only yoga class this Wednesday, December 4th, at 9pm in the Main Lounge. I'm very excited for you guys because the yoga instructor coming is not only an NU alum, but she's my own yoga instructor and I think she's great. Yoga is also great. This class will be all levels, and you don't have to be super flexible or strong. It will magically work for anyone. The class will be focused on stress relief and relaxing the muscles that get tight from too much time at a computer. 

Because the room isn't very big, and because I need to request yoga mats (or you can bring your own), I need to do a sign up for the class. Last year, everyone who wanted to get their asana on was able to, but sign ups help. SO. Please email me if you'd like to go, and if more than 10 people respond (that's how many fit in the room), I'll create a waitlist. 

And then when you're done, munchies will taste doubly delicious. 


Best,
