Hey Guys,

My contact for Formula (SAE) is looking to reach out to somebody in Northwestern IIE, but their info isn't on the Google Doc. Does anyone have any contacts in IIE or should I just start digging?

Thanks in advance,
Ethan

Hi Ethan,

Can you please use your MSAB connections to put me in contact with someone in charge of the Northwestern chapter of the Society of Industrial Engineers?

I was hoping that a representative would be at the lunch today, but no one from that group came.  Our team is looking for a student with an interest in financial engineering to help us set up a finances and purchasing infrastructure and act as a treasurer.

Best wishes,
Tiernan

        Hello,

        This is to let you know that there is a student leaders luncheon taking place today from 12:00-12:50 in the Dean's Conference Room (L250). This luncheon will be an opportunity to interact with other student leaders, discuss upcoming events, and help improve the McCormick student group experience. Additionally, Dean Ottino will be there, and will be talking about some student groups and initiatives that are on their way for McCormick. The lunch is free and delicious!

        If you have any (albeit last minute) questions, please let me know!

        Best,
