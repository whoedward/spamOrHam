First of all, awesome job to everyone who performed and helped out in the KASA show.  You all were excellent.  Also a big thank you to Davin for organizing and shouldering most of the work for the show, as well as Jihoon for his choreography.
 
To those of you who came out to watch, a big thank you to you too!  If you couldnâ€™t make it, never fear, another big thank you to Rui for getting us someone to videotape it all.  Rui, thank your friend for us again the next time you see him.  You can find a video of the performance here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNztnTvBgs0&feature=youtu.be
 
This video is a composite edit with retouched sound so you can hear it better.  The raw videos (including all the screaming) will be uploaded later.
