Hi all,

Soccer and Ultimate are still scheduled as planned.
Ultimate is tomorrow, at 5PM, vs PARC/Willard. Please wear white, and please meet in the lobby at 4:30. It takes a really long time to get to Long Field, and we can warm up too. We're with CCS for Ultimate. Teams of 7, gender ratio is 4:3, or 3:3 or 4:2 for teams of 6, or 3:2 for teams of 5. Hope we can have a team of 7.

Soccer is also tomorrow, at 8PM, vs PARC/Willard. Meet at 7:30 in the lobby. Dylan will be leading you guys. Wear white please. We are with Shepard. Soccer is played at the Field Hockey field adjacent to SPAC, so not as far. Please please come. There doesn't seem to be too strict of a gender ratio rule, just as long as we get an equal-ish amount. If we have 11 players it is 6:5, 10 5:5 or 6:4, 9 5:4 or 6:3, 8 4:4, 5:3, 6:2. This ratio goes both women:men and men:women. So we really just need enough of both.
Soccer is 20 min halves, no time-outs. Regular rules apply. Watch out for offsides.

Sorry I can't make soccer. I'm really bummed about it. I will be at Ultimate. See you guys at 4:30.
Wear white for both sports. No. Metal. Cleats.
