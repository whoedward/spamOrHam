Professor,

12:30 is perfect. I will see you then and we can go over things. Thank you for your patience.

    Hi Ethan,

    I pulled and tested your lab2. It's condition remains the same as before. The issue is that your lab2 handin is missing large parts of the assigned implementation.  This is why it is crucial to do the steps we outlined at the end of the lab handout and on Piazza to test your handin.  The code you submitted has no aggregators, joins, etc.  Even your lab3 branch lacks this code.  In other words, because your repo has no evidence that you did the lab, I can't change the grade.

    If your code does not pass the test outlined at the end of the lab, and in Piazza, it is impossible to grade.  In the future, you should test your checkin.  We strongly recommend that you do this on a computer other than your own.  For example, you can ssh into the teaching lab and do the clone, etc.  What you see there is what the grader sees. 

    We can meet on Monday at 12:30.  In the meantime, since Lab 2 is done, are there any parts of it you want me to patch for your Lab 3?

        Professor,

        If possible, I would like to meet with you on Monday. I am available any time before one or after two. If you are free during those times, please let me know.

        Concerning my lab2: I rebuilt the build.xml file (ran ant dist) and pushed that to github. Hopefully that helps things. If not, that is also something to cover if we can meet.

        Please let me know if you need any more information.

        Thank you for your help,

            Hi Ethan,

            My next availability for meetings is on Monday.

            In the grade announcement from earlier, I outlined a one-time opportunity for you to appeal your Lab 2 grade.  If you can demonstrate that the issue is not in your source code, and just an environmental snag, then checkin a fix (that does not touch lab/src or your answers.*) and I will grade your unit tests for 90% of their initial point values. 

            If you don't want a regrade, I can patch the code you have to make sure you don't spend too much of this lab fixing up Lab 2. It's your call.

                Thanks for the help! Now that I've looked at those posts (and also my grade), I realize that I need to do something about the results. 

                With that in mind, is it still too late to fix things? I realize that running on my local machine is no excuse for not running elsewhere, but I passed all but one test and would really like to get a better grade if possible.

                That said, I'm having a slew of problems and am not really sure where I should begin to fix things. Could I make an appointment to meet with you individually to fix things?

                Best,
                Ethan Robison

                        I am a student in your 11 a.m. databases course.
                        As of yet, I have not received a grade for lab 2. I just wanted to check to make sure that it was submitted and received, and that you don't need anything additional from me. Please let me know if you do and I will fix it immediately!

                        Best,
