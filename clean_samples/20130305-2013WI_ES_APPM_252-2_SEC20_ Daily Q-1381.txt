Class,

The DailyQ was originally based on a question from another class, in which the path is taken in the clockwise direction. We adapted the problem to take the integral in the counter-clockwise direction, but neglected to change the sign of the answer.

I've amended DailyQ, answer and I've gone back to give credit to those of you who entered +/- the correct answer.

Sorry for the trouble!
