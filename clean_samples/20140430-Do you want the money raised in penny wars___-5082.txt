After the first two days of Penny Wars, we've raised over $200, and this money could go to your personal fundraising for Relay for Life if you sign up for the ISRC team!

Here's how to sign up:

For your fundraising goal, Relay co-chairs and I suggest that you do at least $50. We'll be able to cover a large portion of this with our fundraising though, so don't worry about that number!

Come help us fight cancer!
