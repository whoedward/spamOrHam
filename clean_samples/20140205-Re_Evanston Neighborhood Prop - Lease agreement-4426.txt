Hi Mary,

Sorry for the delayed response. Mike and I can make it into your office with the relevant information and fees on Monday, February 10th (2/10/14). We should be there in the afternoon. If that time does not work for you, or if you have any questions, please let me know what I can do to help.

Best,
Ethan Robison

    Hello;
     
    Thank you for the business.
     
    Please find attached the lease agreement and tenant ordinance.
     
    At this time we ask that you sign off on the lease and pay the first months rent.
     
    Our office is located at 1316 Chicago ave and if you can stop by within the week, I would really appreciate it.
     
    Please let us know if any questions come up.
     
    Thanks again and enjoy the week.
