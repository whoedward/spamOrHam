Hello, lovely ISRCers!

Please see the email I sent out last night about the DM kids fare, a great opportunity for philanthropy points near the end of the quarter.  As a reminder, it's kind of like Project Pumpkin.  It will be in Norris on Sat., March 8 from 11-1:30. (Check-in begins at 10:30, so that is also when the half-hour shifts begin.)
 
Please fill out this doodle if you want to participate, even if you already responded to my previous email.  One half-hour shift = Half of a philanthropy point

Thanks so much!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
