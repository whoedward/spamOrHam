Hey guys,

I couldn't tell from looking at the meeting notes whether my shift today ended up getting covered, but it looks like it isn't. I have a previous commitment today and will not be able to work. If someone could cover my shift 4-8 I would be really really grateful, and would be happy to compensate you with cookies or candy or whatever snack you want!


Thanks,
Jake Degler
