    Hi all,

    I just noticed that there was an error in the Daily Q due tomorrow (Nov. 5th). The answer is listed as negative, but it should have been positive. Please send me an email with your answer if you've already tried it and been marked wrong; if you haven't tried it yet, just enter the correct answer multiplied by -1.

    Sorry for the mistake!

    Prof. Abrams
