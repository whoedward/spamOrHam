Hey, guys,

Just a reminder that we do have practice today at 8 P.M. Bring your sparring gear just in case today, but I'm not sure if we will be using it.

Also, we have the Winter Activities Fair going on next week Wednesday, January 22nd from 2 - 5 P.M. at Norris. I was wondering if we could have some volunteers to just stand at our booth and just talk to some people who come and go about our club. You obviously don't need to stay for the whole time, but it would be great to get as much help as possible, so please let me know if you can. Thanks, and I will see you all later~

Yours,
Davin
