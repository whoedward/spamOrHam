Hey, guys,

Just wanted to remind you all that there is practice today at 8:00 P.M. Try to come by 7:50 P.M. though, as usual. Starting this week, Master Kallo will come and lead us on Mondays and Wednesdays. Until he comes, we will stretch out, warm-up, and get ourselves ready for his instruction.

Also starting this week, we will be focusing a bit more on sparring during our Wednesday practices. For those who are new, do not worry :) We are not going to just let people loose and have an all-out brawl. Lower belts (about green belt level and lower) will likely only take part in non-contact sparring. For the other levels, you guys are more than welcome to try out the contact sparring (when Master Kallo instructs us as such), but you MUST have full gear. That includes arm guards, leg guards, groin guards (for guys), etc. We have a limited number of chest protectors in our inventory, but that's about it. Alex sent out a link a few days ago for purchasing sparring gear, so you guys can check that out as well. And I just want to clarify that you do not have to do contact sparring if you do not wish to.

That is about all I wanted to say for now. I will see you guys soon.

-Davin
