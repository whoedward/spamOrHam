Hi ISRC!

Research experience can be integral for those of you interested in attending graduate school, and is a great talking point on your resume once you all go on the job search. Also, it's never too early to get started in research.

With that being said, below is a weblink to some excellent NU paid academic year research learning opportunities!

Best,

SUBJECT: Academic year research learning opportunity, DEADLINE 11/16 - RC students welcome

Greetings RC member,

Do you have a good part-time job lined up this academic year?  If you don't, consider applying for a paid NU research aide position through URAP.

I am writing to invite you to apply for a wonderful academic year research learning opportunity with NU faculty through the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP).  The Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP) offers students the opportunity to work with faculty members on their research and/or creative projects.  This program provides faculty with paid research assistant positions that allow students to learn about research practices and realities from faculty mentors.  You are invited to apply for any open URAP positions that interest you, but note that among the posted openings are research projects with faculty who are affiliated RC fellows seeking RC members just like you:

    Christine Helmer, Knowledge and Virtue: The Rationale for College (Willard member preferred)
    Michael Kennedy, Science in Society Writing Fellowship (Slivka member preferred)
    Mike Smutko, The Effects of Electronics Usage by Students during Lectures (ACCI member preferred)

So check out these great opportunities in the weblink below.  Be sure to document in your application bio your Residential College affiliation.  Applications are due by November 16.

Good luck with your application!
