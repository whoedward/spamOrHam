Hi all,
This email is to clarify that if you did not fill out the form I had sent out earlier, it is completely FINE! That form was just for you to indicate what times worked best for you so Philip (the guy in charge) could find a time best for everyone. So if you filled it out, thank you, hopefully the times work OK for you, and for those of you that did not that still wish to play, please feel more than welcome to join us.

Thanks,
Paul Kim

    Hi all,

    IM Schedules have come out:

    We will be playing Floor Hockey at 7:30 on Thursdays
    Basketball on Mondays at 8 and Sundays at 4 (I'm guessing it's gonna be either one depending on the week).

    Official schedules will be coming out within the week, but I imagine we'll start playing the week of the 19th.

    Best,
    Paul
