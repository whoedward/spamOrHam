Hello, lovely ISRCers!

You will get an email later with all the ISRC events for the week, including Book Buddies, but since this is so time-sensitive, I figured I should send a quick email now.

 Book Buddies (reading to little kids!) is this Friday at the EPL from 3:30-5pm. Email Diamanta Panford (jumpstartnu@gmail.com) ASAP if you want to go, and CC me. If you don't email her within the next 12-24 hours, you probably won't get to do Book Buddies this week - space is limited. :( And if you don't CC me (aylagoktan2012@u.northwestern.edu) you won't get a philanthropy point! Thanks!

ISRClove,
Ayla
