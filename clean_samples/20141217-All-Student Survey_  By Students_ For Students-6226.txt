As you may know, ASG is currently surveying all undergraduates. With more information on student priorities across all schools, groups, and communities, ASG can improve on and off campus resources, lobby for updating University policies, and design useful student-centric services.  Your survey responses will help form proposals that will be presented directly to the President and Provost of the University. 

In order to pursue meaningful priorities, we want to hear about your Northwestern experience. Click here for the survey link

We aren't just asking you to rate Northwestern on a 1-10 scale. We want to hear how your academics have intersected with your extracurriculars; how your workload has affected your mental and physical health; how you've built meaningful relationships across a decentralized campus. 

The survey takes about twenty minutes to complete. By sharing your story, it helps us understand what truly is the undergraduate experience at Northwestern and how we can work to improve it. Find the survey @ bit.ly/NUsurvey14

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We hope you continue to give us feedback at any point throughout the year. 

Enjoy the rest of your break & Go 'Cats! 

Julia Watson

ASG President
