> The current tenants are in there until that date, so that's the only thing about why its available then. If you want to apply and put the fees down I attached the paperwork to do so. There is a $40 application fee per student, $60 application fee per cosigner, $340 move in fee, and first months rent due up front $2525! Let me know if you have any questions concerning this!

If it's just a matter of someone coming to get the keys then we can be a little more flexible, but if there are other things associated with that then we'd like to move in as close to the beginning of the school year as possible.
