        Hey guys,

        Can we set up a time to meet before the prod meeting this week to talk a bit about set stuff? I keep having to run off to Bug meetings right after these ones, so I haven't had a real chance to schedule with you guys. A lot of it is just placement of furniture kind of stuff, but there are also some larger questions like where to put the projector screen, where to put ghost tables, etc. I'm free Monday and Wednesday after noon, and Thursday after 1. Let me know what works best for you.

        Thanks,
        Nikolaj
