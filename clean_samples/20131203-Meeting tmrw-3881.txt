Hey guys,

I have a rehearsal from 7-10 pm tomorrow so I can't be at the meeting. 

I can't do the Saturday rotation that I signed up for a month ago because I'm going to a concert... Haha sorry. So I need someone else on that. 

Also, I need next Wednesday 8pm -midnight covered (during finals week).. So can you guys bring it up during shift coverages? 

Thanks!
