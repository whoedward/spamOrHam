Hey guys,

There seems to have been a bit of confusion regarding the 2-4 shift today (12/12).
Juan, you were supposed to cover Will's shift.
Alex, you informed me that you had to catch a different shuttle to get to work.
Please email me or ntssupervisors@gmail.com to help clear up the issue.

Regards,
Ethan
