Hi Jenn,

The Tech Supers were wondering if it would be possible for you to let us know when our new hires get their paperwork in/processed so that we can better keep track of our techs. Just a quick "heads up," is all.

If it's too much trouble, don't sweat it! We know that you're busy.

Best,

Ethan (and all of the techs)
