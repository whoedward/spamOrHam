Class,

For the homework, here's my position on using Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica or any other computational tool to evaluate integrals: If the integral is particularly nasty, you can use one of these programs to solve the indefinite integral, show this step in your work, and then evaluate the bounds of integration afterwards. This way both of us can see what is happening in between.

But be wary of offloading too much brainwork to the computer; you may need it for the written exams.

Hope things are going well,

Karna
