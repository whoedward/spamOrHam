Hello (Round Three),

Attached is a copy of my sample lab report. I do not have the spectroscopy data nor anything of that nature, as they are difficult to digitize. With that said, I apologize for the delay.
Hopefully you won't be rushed by looking it over. Feel free to comment liberally and critically.

Thank you for your time,
Ethan Robison
