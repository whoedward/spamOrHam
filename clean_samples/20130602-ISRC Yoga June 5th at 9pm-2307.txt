Hello all,

Let me know if you're interested in yoga this Wednesday at 9pm in the Main Lounge! You can still go if you don't sign up, but I want to get a sense of how many people are going so we get the right amount of mats sent over. 

And feel free to email me with any requests for the yoga class to pass on to Chelsea (certain poses, areas on the body to focus on, or intensity). 

And don't forget, this is one of the many perks you get if you non-res next year, on top of opportunities to go to XRC trips, socials and munchies! What I'm saying is, please non-res. I will miss you otherwise. 


Best,
