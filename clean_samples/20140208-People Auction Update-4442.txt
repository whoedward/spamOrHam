Hello, lovely ISRCers!

If you still want to donate talents/services to the ISRC People Auction (https://www.facebook.com/ISRCPeopleAuction), you can email me or Thomas anytime between now and ID!  At closed exec, we decided to keep auction submissions open on a running basis.  The bidding will still end the day of ID - Sunday, Feb. 23.  Thank you all!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
