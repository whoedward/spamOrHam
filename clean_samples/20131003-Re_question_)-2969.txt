Hey Angela,

So, basically it's 50% spam-reduction and 50% taking shift coverages seriously. Essentially, what is going to happen (we'll talk about it next week at the meeting) is someone can get a shift covered less than 24 hours ahead of time, but only through personal contact. For instance, you would have to call up someone who owed you a favor (or something like that) in order to get it covered. Then you would communicate the coverage to ntssupervisors@gmail.com.
After all, it would be kind of ridiculous to deny the time and effort that someone put in trying (and succeeding) to get something covered. Mostly we're just tired of reading "laziness" requests.
Hopefully it's not a big inconvenience for you, and please let us know if you have any questions.

Best,
Ethan Robison

    Hey Ethan emm regarding the new policy, so even if someone is able to take this shift they can't? :(
