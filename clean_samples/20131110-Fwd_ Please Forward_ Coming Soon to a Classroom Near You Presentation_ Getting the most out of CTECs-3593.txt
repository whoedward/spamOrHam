Hey everyone!

As many of you know, registration for winter quarter is coming soon! The Residential College Board is holding an event tomorrow to help you understand CTECs and maybe answer some questions you might have about picking the best professors and classes. There will also be free Giordano's pizza, so make sure you attend! Have a wonderful week!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan

Have you looked through CTECs and thought, "Why on earth are there so many numbers and statistics"?

Do you feel swamped by the all of the reviews people have left on CTECs and don't know what to think about them?
