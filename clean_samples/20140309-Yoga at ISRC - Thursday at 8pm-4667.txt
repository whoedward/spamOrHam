Hello ISRC,

The quarter is almost over! And like always, we've got another Reading Week yoga class for you. The lovely Chelsea will be back to guide you through a chill yoga practice, so you'll have another chance to stretch out and open those chakras in the Main Lounge. Yoga is happening at 8pm on Thursday in the Main Lounge, but I recommend getting there a few minutes early to set up your mat and find your happy place. And like always, this is an all levels class, so beginners welcome! 

You don't have to RSVP, but I do need to request mats, so if you could shoot me back an email that you're planning on going, that'd be great. And if you have your own mat, bring it just in case! 

Enjoy your warm reading week and I'll see some of you at Todoroki!

Best,
