I am a ridiculous person.  I should never ever be put in charge of a group email account.

Before I begin: whoever put the Club Swim Google group page in Spanish is my least favorite person right now. 


ANYWAY. 

Dear swimmers and swimmettes,

Mark your calendars, everyone, because Club Swim is about to roll in the dough (Literally? Does Cosi have baked goods?).  Where is this dough coming from, you ask? Well.....

WE'RE HAVING A FUNDRAISER!!!!

It's going to be SUNDAY, MAY 11 at COSI from 11:30 - 4:30. We get 10% of all profits from those hours (you don't even have to mention the club!), so come one, come call, be there, or be square, and bring all your friends!

Remember, the more money we make, the more money we have to do cool stuff! (What? Did you say Extreme Trampolining?) 
JUST DO IT. IT'LL BE FUN.  YOU'LL HAVE MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE.  (And whoever put the group in Spanish can get off my shit list)


Here. Have a picture of a cat rolling in dough to get you in the spirit.


Love you all!! (Even the Spanish perpetrator, I swear!)
xoxoxox,
Maddie M. (And the rest of exec. I guess they're pretty important, too)
