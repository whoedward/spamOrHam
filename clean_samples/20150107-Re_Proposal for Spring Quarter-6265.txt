I think this is a great idea.  It will help make the fall quarter much smoother.

    Hey guys,
    So Yang and I were talking and we thought about the idea of a transition period for the new supervisors next year. Since there's a decent chance that we may all be gone, we could use the second half of spring quarter as a training period for the new supers (for both technical and supervisory skills). 

    Thoughts?
