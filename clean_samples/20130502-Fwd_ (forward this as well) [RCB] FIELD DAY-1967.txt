Greetings!

Come out and support you RC at RCB FIELD DAY! Fight for its glory!

Compete in events like the human-sized foosball bracket, a tug of war, and the pie eating contest and the LEGENDARY Master's Mile. Only one RC can take home the coveted trophy, but EVERY RC RESIDENT can have a great time, get FREE FOOD AND SWAG and win RAFFLE PRIZES at the event. 

Also: earn points for your RC by "liking" the RCB Facebook page and voting for your RC in the Popularity Contest! If you do both, your name will be entered in a drawing for one of two $50 Amazon.com gift cards. 

And don't forget: tomorrow from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. tomorrow, donate your change to Relay for Life in the RCB Penny Wars competition! The RC that gets the most change and the least dollar bills (those count against you!) will get the lion's share toward their Relay fund. 

(and if you miss the fun tomorrow, catch Penny Wars again at Lisa's Cafe on Friday, 9-5)

MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR
