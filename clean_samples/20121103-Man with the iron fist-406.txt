Hey everybody,

So this is super last minute.  But Ji-Hoon, Albert, and I are going to see the 8pm showing of "man with the iron fist" tonight at the evanston century 21 cinema (the only one in Evanston and closest walking distance from campus).  Let me know if you are interested in coming.  We are going to meet in the lobby at 7:50pm tonight, then go get seats and what not.

-Alex
