My pleasure. I'm writing a very detailed shift report right now.
Regardless of how interesting  the circumstances were, Dean Worsdall was pretty pleased at how the event turned out in the end.

Thank you to Michael for answering my questions and to Pete for coming to our aid.

Go Norris!

    FYI PSV.


    Thank you to tech staff, they are rock stars.â€‹  They solved the key issue, one key had detached from the Ryan set, they found it in the drawer.  That is solved and they are helping client with Ryan system.  I came in and solved the curtain issue by scaling a wall and doing dangerous things.  It is now stuck open, which is better than stuck closed.  Happy Saturday!

    I had no knowledge of this event being in Ryan. 

    The key issue surprises me, my staff uses them frequently.

Will Hyun ran to Ryan but had trouble with the curtains and drawer where microphones are stored.  He is rushing a portable set up as we speak.
