Hello Sups!

I volunteered to be the heard of the planning committee for our end of year party brainstorming! I would like to schedule our first meeting for Thursday Nov. 14th. at 4:00 in the hollow (that way if you're on shift you can still attend). The party planning committee is on VOLUNTEER basis so unless you happen to be on shift, you won't get paid. That being said if you or any of your staff members are interested please forward this message to them!
