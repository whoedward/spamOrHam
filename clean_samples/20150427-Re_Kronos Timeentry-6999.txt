Chris,

It looks like Daniel lost his ability to swipe in. I remember he was able to do during his shift last week. Do you know what's wrong?\

In the meanwhile Daniel, go ahead and sent an email to Chris with swipes you are unable to do. The format is:

Name
Date
Time

From,
Michael Wang

    Hey Michael, 
    When I tried to swipe in today, it said something along the lines that I didn't have a job to swipe into. I was wondering what I should do in the meantime until it gets fixed.
