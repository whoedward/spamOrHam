Hi all,

I hope that everyone's week is going well and that the rain is not dampening anyone's spirits. For our social justice walkover this quarter, I am hoping to go to the Gregg Kindle lecture tomorrow entitled "Building inclusive communities" in Fisk Hall at 7PM. To those who decide to attend, not only will you receive my eternal affection and unrelenting praises but you will also get to choose between complementary candy, Andys, pizza or Northwestern apparel after the event. For any takers, lets meet tomorrow at 6:50PM to walk over as a group. E-mail me if you are interested!

Best,
Danny
