Hello, ISRC! 
Green Cup starts tomorrow. If you didn't already know, Green Cup is a competition between NU residences to see which residence can 1) reduce their energy and water usage the most 2) have the highest participation in eco-rep events. The prize is a fabulous trophy and a to-be-decided event. Everyone in ISRC is participating in this competition.  

Attached to this email is a pdf with more information on the Green Cup, including ways to reduce your energy and water usage. Please check it out! 

Thank you! Let's rock it, like Captain Planet.
