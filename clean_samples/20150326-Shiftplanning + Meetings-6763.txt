Dear NTS:

Weekly meetings now have their own shifts on shiftplanning, as they are required for NTS employees and also to accurately report hours worked. 
Future trainings will also be posted on shiftplanning, and our use of shiftplanning will be much more thorough. Look out for more information at our first meeting. Our goal is to have total hours worked on shiftplanning match exactly as the hours worked on Kronos. 

Also at our first meeting, please bring shifts that you want to give up or trade permanently for the quarter. Of course, our weekly meetings are at 7pm on Wednesdays, location TBA.
And as usual, release shifts on shiftplanning that you would like covered temporarily.

Hope you're having a great Spring Break,
William Hyun
