Hello!

Thank you very much to Joyce and Daniela for volunteering to help from 4-6PM.  There are a couple out-of-house things, so here's who will be doing what:

Angela & Daniela - work the normal 4-6pm shifts.  There are a few setups, but nothing too bad

Joyce - take the screen & projector up to the Great Room; leave at 5 and event starts at 6. It's only a delivery, so once the client is set, you can come back and attend the meeting

Alex - do the Block Museum out-of-house, which is a couple mackies.  leave by 4:30, set up by 5.  You'll meet the DJ then and once he's good, you can go.

The events both end at 8, so at the meeting we'll get some people to go take them down. 

Please help each other get equipment together and anything else they need.  Thanks again for doing this.

Best,
Christina
