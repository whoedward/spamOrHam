Hey everyone, not to be a bother since I feel inexplicably guilty whenever I ask anyone to take a shift of mine anyway, but I will be a hundred or so miles away during this shift and will make a balloon animal for anyone who could give me a hand.  All that's needed is the 6-8 part of the shift, and that's just one hour before the meeting anyway.  Thanks everyone, and sorry for all the emails.

                    Can anyone possibly grab this?  I can swap one for later in the week/finals week, if you'd like.

                            Hey friends,
                            It looks like I won't be back until Thursday, so I wanted to check if anyone could grab my Wednesday 6pm-10pm.  It's during the meeting so you'd be going there anyway.  This way you just get paid more.  Hooray.  Lemme know yall.  Thanks!
