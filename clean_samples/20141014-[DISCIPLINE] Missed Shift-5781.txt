Alex,

It looks like you missed a shift today from 6-8 PM. It was originally Sandy's shift, but you covered it for the week. Since you are a new employee and a mistake was also made on our part by not updating ShiftPlanning, this is just a friendly reminder that you are as responsible for tracking your shifts as we are, if not more.

If you have any issues, let us know.
