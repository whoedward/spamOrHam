Hi everyone!

Residential Services has given us permission to paint a mural in the basement of ISRC. I want this to be a project that everyone in ISRC can be involved with. Please send me any designs or ideas that you may have, so we can formulate an idea of when and what we'll do. Thanks!

ISRC-Love,

Nathan
