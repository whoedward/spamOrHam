Hi ISRCers, 

My name is Miranda Zhao and I was a resident of ISRC 2010-2012. I'm sending you this email to invite you to attend Alexis Lasker's memorial service tomorrow. 

Alexis was a ISRC resident 2010-2011, and a non-res 2011-2012. Some of you might know her, but she was a great member of the community. She passed away this past weekend. We will be hosting a memorial for her tomorrow at 7pm in Harris 108 (Leopold room). Please come and help us celebrate her life, and stay together as a community. If you have any questions, you can reach out to me at mirandazhao2014@u.northwestern.edu, or Gina Tremmel at ginatremmel2014@u.northwestern.edu. 

Hope to see you there. 

ISRC-Love
