Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I'm so sorry to bombard you with so many emails, but here we go: If you're going to the football game on Saturday, and/or if you want to help raise money for the ISRC DM team, DO CANNING AT THE GAME! I might be going, and two of your lovely CAs, Hali and Matt, will definitely be going. If you don't know what canning is, it's basically peddling - going around with cups/cans and asking for money. It's often pretty effective for fundraising, surprisingly! EMAIL ME IF YOU WANT TO CAN ON SATURDAY! I have to know by 11am tomorrow how many cans to pick up for you guys. :) Thank you all!!!

ISRClove,
Ayla
