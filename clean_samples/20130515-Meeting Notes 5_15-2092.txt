Hi NTS,

Here are the notes from tonight's meeting

Announcements

After Ryan events, make sure the client cleans up the auditorium; it is our responsibility to ensure that the venue gets cleaned up before the next event. If the client leaves or refuses to clean up, you need to clean it up by yourself, then email Michael.

Sign up for Norris's 40th anniversary event; there's free food and we still need people working the event.

There is an early open Saturday, and we need one tech to work it from 6-8am. I know its early, but we need someone; its pretty easy, a speaker + mic.

Shift Coverages

Michael Thurs 6-8pm -----> Ethan
Tim P. Monday 2-4pm ----> Max
Christina Wed 6-8pm -----> Max
