So I am not sure if this other version works. Please let me know. Should I send it to Nichols, or has she already gotten it?
 
 
Thank you.

    Also if we could make sure my other source is good, that would be great. It has .gov in it, so I think it is legtimate, but I want to make sure

        Hey Guys!
         
        I edited this to include the rest of the people in the group and added a few words to the questions. If we could look it over for grammar and resend it to Professor Nichols, that would be awesome.
         
        Thanks.
         
        Sincerely,
        Maddy Kelly
