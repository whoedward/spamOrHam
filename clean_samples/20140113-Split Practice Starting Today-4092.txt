Hey, guys,

Hope you guys are all starting off Week 2 well. I just wanted to remind you guys that starting today we will be splitting our practice sessions. 8-9 P.M. will be for all the color belts and 9-10 P.M. will be for the black belts. If black belt members still want to come to the 8-9 P.M. session, you are more than welcome to come and take part and help out. Color belts are also welcome to stay for the 9-10 P.M. session, but keep in mind that there will likely not be any assistance from the advanced members during that time. See you guys at practice~

Yours,
Davin
