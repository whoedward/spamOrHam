Hey, guys,

So as some of you may know, our club usually holds a fairly big demo sometime in Spring Quarter for the KASA Show. And although we have not heard back from KASA yet regarding the date of the show, I think it would be fair to assume that it would be sometime in early May.

With that said, I would like to start preparing for this demo, and WE NEED PEOPLE! As of right now for the show, we're thinking of running through some forms in beat to some K-Pop music, holding a short combat skit, and doing some board breaks. Everyone is welcome, regardless of rank, experience, age, time with the club, etc. Please do not think that just because you are new that you won't be able to contribute. Also, I don't plan on spending time outside of our regular practice times preparing for this, so hopefully time commitment won't be an issue either. We will mostly be working on the demo during our Saturday practices.

It should be a good time with a great crowd.

I know the date is not finalized yet, so you probably won't be able to give me a definite answer, but do let me know if you're interested in participating.

That is all.

Yours,
Davin
