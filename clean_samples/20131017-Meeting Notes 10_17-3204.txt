Hi everyone, here are the notes from last night's meeting.

Announcements:

Training

There are training pamphlets in Michael's office that everybody needs to complete. For returning techs, the first few should be things that you do on a regular basis and completing them shouldn't take long. For new hires, these pamphlets will help guide you through the most common things we do. These pamphlets need to be signed off by a supervisor, which you can do if you're on a shift with us or if you come to our office hours.

Our office hours are:

Tim: Monday 2-4 PM
Ethan: Tuesday 4-6 PM
Bobby: Wednesday 1-3 PM

Phoebe: Wednesday 5-7 PM

Alex: Thursday 2-4 PM

Christina: Friday 1-3 PM

Mike: Saturday 12-2 PM

We will also have group training sometime soon - these will occur on Saturday mornings most likely. We will have 3 dates available and you must sign up for at least one of them. If you cannot make any of them, contact us and we'll set up an individual time for you.

Supervisor Phone Numbers - all the supervisors are on call 24/7, so if there's a problem that you can't figure out, call one of us and we'll try help as much as possible. Our phone numbers are listed on the Phone list tab of the schedule.

Sweeping - please make sure you are sweeping the building and communicating with the person on shift to make sure nothing gets missed event-wise or when cleaning up.

Shift Coverages - if you need a shift coverage during the week, please try to use Shiftplanning to request the coverage.
