Good evening NTS,

NU Nights has just ended at Ryan and I have found myself without reentry in Norris!  Therefore, the second walkie and keys, plus the keys to Ryan will have to remain in my care until (later this) morning.  But fear not.  I shall be returning to Norris by around 9 am with such items, as I am signed up for an all-day Ryan event tomorrow (today).

In sum,  ALL KEYS AND WALKIES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY 9 AM SATURDAY.

Thank you for your patience,

Marina
