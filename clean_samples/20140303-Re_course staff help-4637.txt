Hi Robby,

I am interested in helping out with 211. Please let me know what I need to do to be eligible.

Best,
Ethan Robison

    Dear all: if you think you'd like to help out as course staff for one of our lower-level courses next quarter, please let me know. I expect we'll need help for 211 and 214 (the course formerly known as 311) and possibly others. Exactly which courses will need help is not yet clear.

    It would pay $10/hour and you'd be expected to work 6 hours per week.

    Please let me know if you are interested.

    Thanks,
    Robby
