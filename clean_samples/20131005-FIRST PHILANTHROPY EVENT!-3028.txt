Hello, lovely ISRCers!

This is what you've all been waiting for... yup, you guessed it, the FIRST PHILANTHROPY EVENT!!!!! It's a food drive for the Hillside Food Pantry through the Hillside Church in Evanston. It also happens to be connected to another philanthropy event that I've talked about - the Zombie Walk at the EPL from 6-8pm on Friday, October 25. The deal is we ISRCers collect as much as we can for the food drive, and I bring it to the Zombie Walk to donate. HERE'S THE COOL PART - it will be a competition based on suite color!!!! There are four teams - Red, Blue, Green, and Rust/Mocha. (Just to clarify and provide an example, 1-Red, 2-Red, and 3-Red are all on the same team.) The idea is to facilitate socializing between floors!!!! Yay ISRClove!!!! Okay, anyway, the winning team will get $50 to order food and have a mini-party or something fun like that. :) I will put the collection box in the main lounge tomorrow. At the end of this email is a list of food items you can donate. Alternately, you can put $2.50 (or any multiple of that) in an envelope in the box and exec board will buy food items for you. 1 food item, or 1 multiple of $2.50, is 1 point for your team. IF YOU WANT POINTS, EMAIL ME YOUR NAME AND SUITE. Not only will you get 1 point for your team, but you will also get 1 philanthropy point for yourself!!!!!ow here are the logistics:

Boxed Items: 1 lb packages/boxes of spaghetti or other dried pasta
