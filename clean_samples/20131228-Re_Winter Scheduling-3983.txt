Hey everyone,

I hope you guys have had a nice break so far. I'm working on the schedule for next quarter so if you haven't updated your availability on Shiftplanning or told us how many hours you want to work/preferred shifts yet, please do so soon. Here's the link to the google Doc:

Thanks,

Alex

    Hi guys,

    I hope everyone's finals went well. We need to get our schedule made for next quarter, so we need you guys to update your availability on Shiftplanning. As we mentioned before, if you have a class from 9-10 and from 12-1, please put down that you are available from 10-12. We not schedule you for that time block unless you're the only person available. You can adjust your availability by going to to shiftplanning website, going to your dashboard and clicking availability.

    In addition, please fill out this Google doc so we know what shifts/how many hours you want to work this quarter.

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApuKKvAxgTAqdDhmUS10OEY0RU9BVGRWVVJ4ZENrZVE&usp=sharing

    The earlier everyone fills this out the earlier we can get a schedule out for everyone, but please try to get this filled out within 10 days.

    Happy Merry Christmas/Kwanza/Boxing Day/Bake Cookies Day,
