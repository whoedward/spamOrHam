    Ethan:

    You scored a 154 on the final exam while the class had an average of 136. You had a 77% in the end while the class average was a 73%. The class average was, as indicated all during the term the C+/B- break line.  Your numbers put you squarely in the B range.

If you have it, I would be happy to hear it from you; if it's someplace obvious, if you could just point me in the right direction, that would be great, too. I apologize if I missed an email/announcement that explained the process or anything like that.
