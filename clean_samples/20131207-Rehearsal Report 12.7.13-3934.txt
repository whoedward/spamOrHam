Rehearsal Notes:

    We were able to run through almost the entirety of Act 1 today (without the Antony speeches at the end), and go over the fight choreo we learned a few days ago. The fight choreo still needs a lot of practice, and a few changes were made today, but it looked good for now! Practice will help us a lot.
    Once we get back from break, we’ll be 1.) OFF BOOK, and 2.) finally getting to work on Act 2! Act 2 of the show is much shorter than Act 1, but we’ll be doing some review, then working and blocking Act 2 and once that is done, putting everything together.
    Thanks for coming, Matt!

Scenery Notes:

    None today!

Prop Notes:

    At the bottom of page 15, when Cassius gives Cinna a “paper” to drop by Brutus’ window, Cassius (Taylor) will be need to be holding a pile of leaflets or papers from which she gives one to Cinna (Selina.)

Costume Notes:

    Thank you, Elise, for coming in to do the remaining measurements. I’ll get in contact with David to have him send you his.
    When the conspirators all come to Brutus’ house at the beginning of 2.1, they will need to be wearing some sort of black clothing to cover their faces.

Light Notes:

    None today!

Sound Notes:

    The third cheer for Caesar in scene 1.2, since it is not in the script, will be right before Brutus’ line on pg. 7, “The games are done and Caesar is returning.”

Miscellaneous Notes:

    See you tomorrow night!
