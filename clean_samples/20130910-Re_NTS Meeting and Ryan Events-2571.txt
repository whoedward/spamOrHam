Hello everyone,

Just to give on insight on how we handle our scheduling, we have sent out a notice to all of our staff asking for their Fall class and extracurricular schedule. Its a simple spreadsheet made in Google Docs, and on it we ask for the staff member to indicate their preferred shifts for the quarter. We then make the schedule ourselves based on the availability given to us. For Ryan events, we have a board of events given to us by Michael and during each meeting we ask for volunteers to cover these events.


Best,

Alex Yang

    Hey All,

    I just wanted to let the supers and Michael know that I can take the Sunday Ryan event.
    Pete: will both of your staff members be shadowing the event?

    Best,

        Hello!

        My name is Christina and I am one of the NTS supervisors this year.  Our first meeting with all of the NTS staff will be on Friday, September 20 at 7 PM.  I don't believe the location has been confirmed yet, but it will be in a meeting room at Norris.  

        Also, we can have your staff and ours meet at Ryan for events.  NTS staffers can pick up the key from Norris for now.

        It'll be a pleasure working with you and your staff!  See you all on the 20th!

        Sincerely, 
        Christina
