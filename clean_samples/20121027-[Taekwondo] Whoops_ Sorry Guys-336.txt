Hey everyone,

I didn't realize Blom was going to be closed today (again). Very sorry about that. However, I'll still have that extra sparring practice tomorrow at 3 for everyone who would like to get their weekly pre-tournament sparring in. It was very productive last Sunday, so we're going to try to have it again. Same deal as last week where it'll just be a bonus practice for anyone and everyone.

Also, please reply by Monday night if you are planning to compete at Purdue. I need a full headcount, and if you're not on the list, you won't be able to go.

We're also going to try to get as much sparring in practice as much as we can since we officially haven't been able to get any sparring in our normal practices due to Blom being consistently closed on Saturday, so bring your sparring gear Monday if you have it.

Ji-hoon
