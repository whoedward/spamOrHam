Hey all,

I know everyone's heading into the main chunk of midterm season, but I was wondering if anybody would be willing to take either my 10am-noon shift, noon-2pm shift, or both tomorrow.

I've got a paper and a midterm on Tuesday, and then another paper and possibly another midterm (the prof doesn't tell us on what specific Wednesday they'll be) on Wednesday, so this is kind of a crazy week for me.

Thanks,

Ryan
