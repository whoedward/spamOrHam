Hey guys,

Tomorrow is the last Cross-RC trip of the quarter, and we have an ISRC-er with a ticket who can't go. If you remember the ticket policy, if you buy a ticket then cancel, you have to pay the full price, because the university doesn't like funding unused tickets. Anyways, the person is so desperate, he's offering to pay the supplemented price, so the ticket doesn't go to waste. If anyone wants to go for free, let me know ASAP.

We will be going to see the Christmas Schooner from 6pm-10pm tomorrow (we'll get picked up and dropped off right outside ISRC). The trip is to Southport, one of my personal favorite areas of Chicago, not too far from here, near Belmont. We'll have a little bit of time to grab food (I will be grabbing the best flourless chocolate cookies ever) and then we'll head to the lovely Mercury Theater for the performance of the ultimate Chicago Christmas play, a musical about this German guy who almost dies bringing German immigrants Christmas trees on a boat. Apparently this newest production is really awesome, and I guess a cool look at Chicago's history. I am not a fan of musicals, but I got convinced it's worth going to. There is a big group of us (9!), so you'll definitely know someone going. 

ANYWAYS, let me know if you want the ticket! 

Best,
