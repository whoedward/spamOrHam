Hey ISRC,
 
Relay for Life is tonight SPAC!  On-site team registration begins at 6, and the actual event starts at 7.  For anyone who wants to help me register our team and carry over blankets, card games, etc., we can meet in the main lounge at 5:45.  That time may change (I might make it later), but for now that's the plan.  If you have questions or concerns, let me know!
 
Thanks,
Ayla
