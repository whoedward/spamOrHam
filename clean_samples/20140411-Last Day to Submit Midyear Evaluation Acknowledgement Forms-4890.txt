Good morning everyone!

Thank you to all supervisors who have turned in the Midyear Evaluation Acknowledgement forms for your assigned student employees!  If you haven't done this yet, please remember that you have until 5:00pm today to turn them in to Jennifer Stripe, Payroll Coordinator.  These forms are available from the area's full-time staff supervisor.

Best regards,

The Norris Student Employment Committee
