Hello Professors,

Team Four here. We were reading the textbook for fun and happened to notice a passage that mentioned that we should be including our instructors in all email correspondances. We wanted to know if the two of you considered this to be significant, and whether you would like to be "Cc'd" into our interaction.

Best,
Team Four
