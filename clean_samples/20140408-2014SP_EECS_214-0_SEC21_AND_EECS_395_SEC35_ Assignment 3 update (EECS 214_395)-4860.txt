Initially in Assignment 3 we asked to submit the .jar file only, it has now been changed to submission of both the .jar file and your source code in a text file. Other parts of Assignment 3 are intact.

Let's recap, you need to hand in two files:

1. .Jar file of your code

2. .txt file containg the source code


Some of you had been asking what "hardcode" is. Well, instead of asking the user to enter the input array and value of x you can directly embed those values in your source code. 


I hope this helps.


Best,

Samarth
