Hi everyone, here are the notes from yesterday's meeting

Announcements

Norris will be closed from 6pm on Wednesday, Nov 27th until Sunday, December 1st. If you have a shift on Sunday and will not be back into time to make it, please make sure to find shift coverage. There will be no meeting next week.

The time clock will be down starting today, going through this Saturday. This means you will not be swiping in using the usual system. There is a sheet posted on the door of the lab where you can mark which hours you worked and Michael will enter them into the system manually.

If you are going to be staying here for winter break and want to get more hours, Norris will be open until the 21st and we need a few people to work each day - please contact us or Michael so we can get you scheduled.
