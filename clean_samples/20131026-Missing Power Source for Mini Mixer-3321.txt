Today I went to set up the event in Parkes Hall and found that the mini mixer's power source was missing. It was being used last night in Dittmar, so I called Magan (who was on the rotation last night) and he said that they were using a bunch of sound boards last night for NU Nights (one didn't work) and there was probably a mix-up when they cleaned everything up at the end.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize the power source was mixing until I took it to Parkes and opened up the mixer case. I tried looking for it afterwards but I did not find it... I'm not sure what to do now.
