Hi Wildcats!

The FINAL Peer Adviser Call Out (information session) is being held today at 5 p.m. in Harris 107. Attendance at a call out session is required to complete the PA application, due tonight at 11:59 p.m.

There are a host of reasons why you should apply, the main reason being the opportunity to positively impact the lives of our newest community members and to give back to Northwestern.
