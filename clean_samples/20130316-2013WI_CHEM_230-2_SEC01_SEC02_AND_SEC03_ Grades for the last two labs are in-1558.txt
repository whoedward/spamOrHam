Hello Everyone!

So I wanted to let you know that you can see your grades on your last two lab reports on blackboard. I strongly employ you to come and pick these up before wednesday when its now in Dr. Priests hands. That way you can look over them and we can discuss any discrepancies you might have. In general I noticed the inevitable trend where some of the underdogs worked hard to improve more so normal. The average for the lab 6 was 81.67 and the average for lab 7 was 83.4.

Email me when you think you can stop by approximately on monday and tuesday so that I can make sure I am in my office at those times. I hope this helps. Good job all and good luck with finals!

Sincerely,
Cornelius
