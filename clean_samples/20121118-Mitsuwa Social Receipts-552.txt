If you went to Mitsuwa yesterday and didn't give your receipts to Anthony, hand them in to me by MONDAY, Nov. 26th so I can try to turn them in before leaving for Thanksgiving!

Your options are:
1. Give them to me at Open Exec tonight (and earn yourself half an open exec point, yay!)
2. Stop by 113 and hand them to me
3. Stop by 113 and slide them under the door if I'm not around.

Put your FULL NAME at the top so I know who to reimburse!!

Also, I made this colorful because I know college kids have inexplicably short attention spans.
