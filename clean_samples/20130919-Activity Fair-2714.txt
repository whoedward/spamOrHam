	Hello grappling enthusiasts,

Welcome back to those of you that are back already and safe travels back to those of you who aren't!
The fall activity fair is this Sunday the 22nd from 12-5:30. This is the main time that we promote our club and get new members. If any of you can help out, that would be great. If you're interested let me know.

remember, position before position before submission!

Jacob
