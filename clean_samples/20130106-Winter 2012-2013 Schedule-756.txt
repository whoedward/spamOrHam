Hi NTS,

We've completed the schedule for the next quarter. This is still a work in progress, and if you see any conflict in your schedule, email them over the listserv ASAP.

This schedule is effective starting tomorrow, so please check the schedule and make note of your new shifts.

If you don't see your name on the schedule, that means you didn't email us your availability for winter, so email us at ntssupervisors@gmail.com immediately. We tried to be as fair as possible, but if you have any problems with your hours, contact me.

Thanks,

Alex
