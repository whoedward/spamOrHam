Hello,

The ladies of Sigma Alpha Iota are trying to earn money for t-shirts for our annual Valentine's Day Rose Sale. You can help us out by taking just a few minutes of your time to complete a few tasks on this website: http://www.pearup.com/sairosesale
It costs no money and it's super easy! (If you don't like sharing things on your Facebook, you can delete it right after you post and we still get the points). 

So, tl;dr: Visit this site:http://www.pearup.com/sairosesale and do the quick tasks to help SAI raise money for new t-shirts. And don't forget to check out Rose Sale February 10th -14th
