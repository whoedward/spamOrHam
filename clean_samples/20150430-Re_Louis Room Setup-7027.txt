Got it. I think given the situation what you did was right but consider calling Chris next time and asking if he knows where the gaff tape is, because painters tape doesn't tear cleanly and it sticks around the wires making it a pain to clean.

None of y'all are in trouble tho

        Did you use the blue tape to tape down the wires?
