Hi everybody,

For those of you who don't know me, I'm your treasurer Victor, and I'll be explaining reimbursements for those who will be purchasing materials for the suite decorations. 

So what are reimbursements? Basically, what happens is you spend some money, you give me the receipt, and I handle the Student Organization Financial Office and get that money back for you.

For the most part, the following won't be too much of a problem but it'd much easier for both you and me to get your reimbursements if you follow the below.

Important Things to Know about Reimbursements: 
-Illinois Sales Tax CANNOT be reimbursed by the university, meaning whatever you may purchase will be partly permanently paid out of your pocket. 

-For anyone who purchases materials using a credit card, be sure you can access your credit statement online just in case more info is needed on your purchase. A single credit statement line is fine, which should contain all the payment info of your purchase. 

Reimbursements of Receipts [IE: What You Have To Do]:
Now onto the actual process. Once you've made a purchase, get back to me with a receipt with the following:

1. Your full name (Written on top)
2. Your suite (Also written on top)
3. An itemized list of purchase (IE: A list of every item purchased)
4. Date of purchase
5. Where items were purchased
6. Address and phone number of vendor
7. Method of payment
8. Zero balance/paid in full.

As mentioned before, the above won't be much of an issue but be sure that everything on the above list is on your receipt once you get it to me. If your receipt doesn't have all of the above, I'll have to ask you to go back and get a new receipt with all the info. 

And that's it. Just hand in a receipt with all the relevant info. Once I've handed in your receipts, you should expect your money back within two or three weeks after SOFO's finished processing them. In the meantime decorate the suites and have fun.

If you have any questions about any of the above, email me or drop by room 106.


Victor
