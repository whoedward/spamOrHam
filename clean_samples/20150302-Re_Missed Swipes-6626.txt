Thank you for sending us the list!  It helps us a lot.  We will talk to those Techs at our meeting on Wednesday.

Best,
Christina

    Hello Supervisors,

    This is the list of staff who didn’t report missed swipes this week.  Some of you (supervisors) also missed swipes, but we’ve already been in contact about those.

    Brian Capella

    Juan Herrera

    Angela Yang

     

    Going forward, I’ll be keeping a running list of everyone who forgets to swipe, and whether I was notified or not.  They’ll be entered into an online document you can all view.  Maybe make a point of checking this log at your weekly meeting, and then determining who will follow up with the staff member.
