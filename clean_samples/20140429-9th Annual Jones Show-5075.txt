Hey ISRC,

Here is a cool event happening at Jones this weekend. Check it out!!!


The 9th Annual Jones Show presents: ENDGAME

Hamm, the tyrant of his dysfunctional family, can sense that this day is special. Different. Scary. Something is coming to an end. Watch Samuel Beckett's classic come to life in this Absurdist play that will have you questioning the premise of reason and hope.

The show runs from Thursday to Saturday (May 1st - 3rd), at 8pm each night for $5 in the Jones Great Room. 
Come support Jones and see one of Samuel Beckett's most acclaimed plays of all time!
