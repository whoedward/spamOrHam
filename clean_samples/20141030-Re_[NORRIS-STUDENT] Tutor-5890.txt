Hi Frank,

I cannot make promises as far as my schedule, but I am willing and most likely able to help someone out.

    Good morning,

     

    I was wondering if there is a Norris student employee who may be interested in volunteering to help another Norris student staffer with tutoring in Math 224.  Please let me know.  This is extra-official so it is not related to work, but helping each other out is always good.

     

    Best,

     

    Frank
