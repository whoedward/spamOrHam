Hey guys,

Just wanted to remind you that there will be no practice this Saturday because of Dillo Day. Go out and enjoy the day. I hear it's supposed to be really nice out.

Monday will be our last official practice. I hope to see all of you guys there.

Wednesday will be our belt testing day. Same procedure: the masters will likely come around 8:30 P.M. Have your form ready to go beforehand, and make sure to warm-up before the test, if you are testing.

Next Saturday is still in the air as to what will happen. I'll update you guys on that soon.

See you guys soon,
Davin
