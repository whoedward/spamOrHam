Dear Michael,

I'm really sorry, but my professor for my chamber ensemble has a really busy schedule with performances this quarter and tomorrow night during our meeting is the only time he could come for a lesson this week, so I will be unable to attend the meeting. I will talk with the other supervisors about what was discussed and I will make sure to clear my schedule for meetings in the future.
