Just so you know, Norris closes early on Friday, so the shifts you need covered will only be from 10AM-6PM.

    If anyone could cover any part of these shifts that would be greatly appreciated! I especially need the second half of my shift covered. I might be able to trade if you need shifts covered today or tomorrow!
