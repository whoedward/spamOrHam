Greetings J1F Residents!

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET FOOD AT 3 AM? WHERE TO MAIL A PACKAGE? HOW TO GET TO CHICAGO?

To test your knowledge, the J1F Staff are proud to bring you the Evanston Photo Safari. a great way to check out the sights and sounds of Evanston as well as win some prizes in the process!

We will give you an entire 5 days (from Monday, November 12th to Friday, November 16th) to explore the recesses of Evanston and check off as many establishments on our list as possible. It'll be a great adventure into the unknown.

Form a group of 3 to 4 J1F area residents and register by the deadline, which is Sunday November 11th at 11:59 pm. All you have to is send an email to your CA that contains the names of everyone in your group. Your CA should email you back with a list of the places you should go and the points for each.

And the best part, there will be DOWNTOWN EVANSTON GIFTCARDS for those who win! Conquer uncharted territories, expand your knowledge of your surroundings and win some free stuff. It is your destiny.

Over and out,
the J1F Staff
