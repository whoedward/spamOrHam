    Hi all,

    I haven't heard back from anyone about this evening. Who can be at practice tonight and who can meet up afterwards for some food and club business meeting?

        Hi all,

        I am going to call class cancelled today. It is very hard to reach critical mass with everyone's current schedules and injuries. Can everyone make it on Wednesday? I would really like to get some training done.

        I also think we have some club business we should take care of. Can everyone make it for a post practice meeting even if they can't train?

            I just got word that Sensei can't make it today. I was still hoping to train today. Is anyone else up for some open mats?
