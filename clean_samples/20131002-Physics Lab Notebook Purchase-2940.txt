Hello Mr. Godek,

My name is Ethan Robison, a student in Professor Taylor's Phys 135-2 class. I am in need of a physics laboratory notebook, and Professor Taylor referred me to you.
As such, are there any notebooks remaining, and if there are, how could I go about purhasing one?
If there is any information that I can provide, please do not hesitate to ask.

Best,
Ethan Robison
