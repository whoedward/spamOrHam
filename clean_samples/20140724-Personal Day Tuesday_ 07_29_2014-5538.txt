Hi Jim,

This is just an email to let you know that I will be out of town on next Tuesday (the 29th); I have to head out of town for an urgent appointment. Hopefully this doesn't cause too much trouble, and please do let me know if it interferes with anything, so that I can rearrange things accordingly.

Best,

--
