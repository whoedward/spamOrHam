Hi Everyone,

Sorry to do this to you guys, but I'm going to need my Sunday 6pm-close covered this week at the meeting. I found someone to cover my Friday afternoon already, but I'd really like to give away my Friday 6-8pm permanently if possible, so if you could get that covered too I would really appreciate it. Thanks guys.
