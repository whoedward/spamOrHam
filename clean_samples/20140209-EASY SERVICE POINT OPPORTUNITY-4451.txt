Hi All!

In anticipation for International Dinner, we are going to need people to deliver paper invites to the fellows.

Fellows offices tend to be in academic buildings, so you likely walk past the offices every single day. A single service point is granted per invite delivered, so consider this a chance to take care of service points for the entire quarter!

Fill in your name next to the fellow in the form below:

Thanks, and I hope everybody is holding up alright after their midterms!

Cheers,
