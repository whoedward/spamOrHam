Hey ISRCers,

Do you enjoy TED Talks? Like learning? Crave coffee?

Come to ResTalks and hear fellow professors intrigue you with fresh stories, ideas, and research with 15-minute talks each. Stick around afterwards for coffee, Bennison's cupcakes, and hanging out with students. 

It's 2 to 4 PM on Saturday, November 17 in Harris 107.
