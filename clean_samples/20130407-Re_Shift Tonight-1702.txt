Hey,

It was actually a really big shift because of an event in Louis as well as several other rooms; I was extremely exhausted and frustrated by the end of the night. I really would've liked the help but I do appreciate the apology and you reaching out.

    Hello,

    So, as you might have noticed, I failed to show up tonight...
     I really hope that the shift was a dull, simple one and that you were not inconvenienced in any way.
     Part of me wants to say that I'm not used to the new schedule, but I still should have been there.
    I'm incredibly sorry, and you can count on me showing up from now on.

    Thanks,
    Ethan Robison
