The One Book One Northwestern selection committee is seeking recommendations for book titles for the 2015-2016 academic year. Book suggestions should include:  title, author, short summary, and a brief description of why this book would make a good common read.

Email proposals and questions to One Book One Northwestern at onebook@northwestern.edu.  The deadline for submittals is Friday, December 12, 2014.

The committee will review initial proposals and invite a smaller number of full proposals for more detailed consideration before making recommendations to President Morton Schapiro.

Please note: the selected book should be available in paperback and digital formats by May 1, 2015. The book will be distributed to incoming students next summer in preparation for the fall quarter.

The One Book One Northwestern program is sponsored by the Office of the President. The selection committee, chaired by Eugene Lowe, assistant to the president, includes students, faculty and staff.
