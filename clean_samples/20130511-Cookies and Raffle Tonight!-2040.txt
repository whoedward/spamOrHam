Hello ISRCers!
 
First of all, if you're not at RCB Field Day, it's not too late to check it out!  I will be refereeing Human Foosball from 2:30-4:15.  Curious?  Me too! :)
 
Second of all, there will be Homemade cookies and a raffle for a $25 Fandango Gift Card in the Main Lounge tonight at 7!!!!!  The raffle tickets will be $2 each and all the money will go to Relay for Life!!!!!  We will also have popcorn and movies. :)  So please check us out and help out Relay for Life, which is this coming Friday!
 
Thanks,
Ayla
