Hi all,

In HW4 problem 4, which is the taxi sign problem, some of you used the value of 1 for the drag coefficient and I took away 2 points for that. I just talked with Prof. Burghardt and I understand why you directly made that estimation. So if you have this issue please send me an email to let me know so that I can add back the points for you. Sorry for the inconvenience guys.

Hongda
