Hey guys,

On the new AV Board there are two equipment deliveries on Wednesday.

1) Deliver small pwrd speaker & stand to Block Museum at 4:30; clean up 8:30
2) Deliver prjctr screen & prjctr to Great Room at 5; clean up 8

Can anyone do setups?  I have class that whole time.  I figure that we can just recruit people after the meeting for cleanups.
