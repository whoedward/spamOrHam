Good morning everyone,

I've had a long day since yesterday, but please don't take this as aggravated nagging.

I came into Ryan this morning (especially the balcony) and found it trashed.

This disaster I know did not come from NU Nights, as I reminded them about cleaning up behind themselves and did a sweep with them myself.  HOWEVER, I was remiss in checking all the areas:  I forgot to go up to the balcony. 

When I did go up there this morning, I recalled some of the NU Nights people the night before complaining about having to clean up after other people, and I believe they are justified:  I found about 15-20 bottles of unopened water, 3 full grande cups of cold coffee, several Papa John's pizza boxes, and at least 4-5 half- or uneaten Whopper sandwiches from Burger King, as well as two full cardboard boxes of refuse.  It took me about half a minute to figure out this disaster was fresh, but not as fresh as NU Nights--they served none of that kind of food at their event.

I have to conclude that this was either from Thursday's Kaibigan event or the National Merit Scholarship Presentation earlier on Friday.  A guy sitting outside the auditorium this morning also told me that one of the neighboring classrooms was completely trashed and that he had had to spend time cleaning up after junk. 

These are all the leads I have.  Please do sweeps after events, gentlemen.  It saves for a lot of grief and exertion in the future.

Thank you.

Marina
