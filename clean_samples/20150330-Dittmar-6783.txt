Hey Chris,

To the best I can guess, here is what I think happened:

On the Thursday the 19th sheets I've got on my email, it says there was a setup of laptop, sound system, etc. in Dittmar for the Norris Staff Social.  I asked Brian and Adrick and they did set this up on their 4-6 shift.  However, seeing as this event did not exist, it should've been cancelled on EMS.  This apparently wasn't communicated to the techs.

Alex Yang and Alex Schlehuber were working the 6-close that day and were told the event was cancelled, so didn't think to check Dittmar.  They weren't aware anything had been set up in there.  Whoever locked up Dittmar that night did not mention the equipment to them either.

Since Techs never have a reason to go into Dittmar except for events, the equipment was never found until you and Michael discovered it the next Friday.  There was a lack of communication that caused this whole thing.  This won't happen again.  

Please let the supers know if there is anything else we can do to help.

Best,
Christina
