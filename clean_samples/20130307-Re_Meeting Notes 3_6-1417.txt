    Hi NTS,

    Here are the notes from tonight's meeting.

    Announcements

    We are going to start doing shift scheduling for next quarter soon, so be on the lookout for an email regarding your spring availability. Please make sure to fill it out in a timely manner, it'll take at most 10 minutes, and the sooner everybody sends in their availability, the sooner we can get a schedule out for next quarter.

    Michael sent out an email a few days ago about new equipment that we have; if you don't know how to use any of them, don't hesitate to ask Michael for help.

    Make sure to meet with the client before the events starts to see if they need any additional equipment and check to see if they know how to work the equipment.

    If you want shifts during spring break, please email us or Michael about it and we can get you scheduled, the hours don't come out of your work-study allotment, so you don't have to worry about not being able to work next quarter.
