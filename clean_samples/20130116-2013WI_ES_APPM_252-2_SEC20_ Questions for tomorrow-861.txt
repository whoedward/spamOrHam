Class,

Email me with any questions about the homework or course material that you might have by 5pm today and I'll do my best to cover them in discussion tomorrow. If nobody has anything, I'll prepare an in-class exercise that ties together some of the ideas you've been learning so far.

See you tomorrow!

Karna
