Hey Norris Staff!

It's time to mark your calendars for the annual Student Recognition Banquet. It's Norris' way of saying thanks to the staff and recognizing outstanding student staffers. Also, free, amazing food! This year, it will fall on the evening of May 28th. Mark those calendars. You won't want to miss it.

Look out for details to come soon!

Peace and Blessings,
Meredith
