AIChE, 

I am going to be driving to the local AIChE meeting tomorrow and am willing to take any other students interested in coming. The plan would be to meet at 4:45 for the approximately hour drive at a central location, either behind tech or in the Foster_Walker parking lot. Let me know if you are interested-I definitely had a good time last month!

You may sign up for the meeting at a cost of $5 using the link below.
