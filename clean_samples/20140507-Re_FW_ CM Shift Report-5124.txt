After looking into this, it turns out the tech was Drew. According to him, his walkie was on the wrong channel. He was told to remember to double check his walkie when coming onto his shift. Luckily the CM said this did not lead to any immediate problem that day.

    Center Manager on Duty = Sean Buckley

    Shift = Weekend Middle

    Event No Shows =

    Last Minute Room Requests =

    Notes from Shift = -JTE and the Jones Show picked up their casbags
    -Tried to unlock a door near the loading dock for a Sodexo employee, but I 
    didn't have the key. I believe Aramark was able to help here
    -The Louis room show came to the info desk to complain about the noise from 
    Philfest. I explained that there was nothing we could do.
    -Filled out the sheets. I did this very quickly, so I apologize if there 
    are any mistakes
    -A&O brought Einstein's bagels and coffee to their meeting. The group had 
    already left by the time I saw the food so I couldn't inform about the 
    catering rules.
    -We were unable to reach tech services for nearly half an hour when someone 
    in Chicago needed tech support. We radioed him several times and eventually 
    Sarah found him on the ground floor near his walkie. He said he didn't 
    notice the walkie calls

    Notes for Later Shifts Today/Opening Shift Tomorrow = -I didn't put many 
    rooms on the close and there are currently none on the open so if either 
    shift is feeling generous, they could set some of the rooms listed for 
    tomorrow's shift.
