Hello, lovely ISRCers!

I am very excited to announce ISRC's first in-building DM fundraising event! It will be a trivia night on Wednesday at 9:45 in the main lounge, combined with munchies. You have to pay to play, but if you show up only for food, you obviously don't have to pay for munchies. :) Esteban is awesome for coordinating this event - see the attached flyer he made for details. Email him (or me if that's easier) if you want to participate!!

ISRC-love,
Ayla
