Hello Jennifer,

My name is Ethan Robison, and I am a freshman in McCormick. Unfortunately, there has been a snafu with meeting with my scheduling advisor. I have not been able to contact him regarding my fall quarter schedule. My advisor is Fengqi You, and given the proximate opening of registration, I would like to meet with an advisor as soon as possible.

Do you have any advice regarding this situation? If there is any information that I can provide to you, please let me know. Additionally, if I should contact anyone besides you (I have already emailed Professor You), please let me know as well.

Thank you for your patience.

Best,
Ethan Robison
