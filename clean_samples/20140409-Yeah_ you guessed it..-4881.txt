Hey guys! So, looks like playing times and teams for IM are out. See below:

Softball: Sundays at 3PM with Shepard
Soccer: Tuesday at 9PM with Shepard
Ultimate: Tuesday at 5PM with CCS

I know, the times kind of blow. I'll let you guys know when the season starts. I may or may not be able to play soccer on Tuesday for the first couple of weeks due to the tutorial, so if anyone is willing to serve as captain in my place for the days I cannot make it, please let me know and we'll exchange contact info.

One last thing: We need a team name. Not 'need' per se, but let's have a team name this quarter. Send in ideas! Otherwise we'll be ISRC/Shepard or ISRC/CCS, which isn't bad but you know. We could be Jackie Chan's Understudies. Or something along those lines.

Sorry for the bland e-mail. Kinda tired.

Boogers.
