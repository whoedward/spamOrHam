Hey, guys,

I just wanted to let you know that tomorrow, we will hopefully be preparing a short demonstration that we can show at the CSSA Festival (February 8th). With that in mind, PLEASE COME TO PRACTICE TOMORROW if you want to be a part of this. Again, all levels are welcome. If you don't want to be a part of this, you should still come to practice tomorrow~ :D

See you guys soon.

Yours,
Davin
