Hey ISRCers,

Along with the election that will take place at open exec tonight, we have a bunch of changes to the ISRC Constitution! These changes are mostly flexibility changes that make positions more clear and make the electoral process a lot smoother. So please give a quick read through and vote on your opinion in the ballot I will send out along with the electoral ballot later on tonight.

Also, remember to come to the main lounge at 6 tonight for Board Game Night!

Cheers,
Thomas
