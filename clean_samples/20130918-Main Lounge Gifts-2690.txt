Hey everyone,

I hope you all are having a SPLENDID Wildcat Welcome so far! I just wanted to send you all a quick reminder about our dorm gifts. From today until Sunday, I will be in the main lounge from 9am to 4pm and some times in the night handing you our gifts and t-shirts. I also will get a picture for our picture roster.

See you all soon!

Thomas
