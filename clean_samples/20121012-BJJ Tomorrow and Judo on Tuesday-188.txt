Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that we BJJ have practice from 2-4pm at Blomquist tomorrow afternoon. Jacob will be out of town so I'll be leading class. See you all there!

Also, judo classes will be starting up this week. Classes will be from 8-9:30pm at Blomquist on Tuesdays. Bring your gi if you have one. If you don't, it's completely fine because we will be going through techniques for gi and no gi situations.
