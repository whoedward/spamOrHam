Hello!

I hope everyone is having a wonderful reading week! The Game Room is happy to announce a used game and equipment sale.  Please view the linked Google Doc and reply with whichever games you would like to buy.  First come; first serve!  Once you've gotten a confirmation from me, you'll be able to pay and pick up the game from the Game Room on Friday, March 13th. Good luck with studying for finals!
