Hey everyone,

There will be two sets of filming happening tomorrow. After our warm ups, we will be filming for Wildcat Welcome people. Then, Kallo comes and we do the stuff with Kallo that we normally do. After Kallo leaves, KASA people will come to film our audition for the KASA Show and we will repeat what we did for the Wildcat Welcome people for the KASA people. So please wear your uniforms to practice tomorrow if you have one.

For the filming, we'll all do the white belt pattern together. Then, we'll make one line for kicking drills, and finally, we'll have a handful, about four or five of us, do flying side kicks over shields.

Also, I've heard back from a handful of you that you do want perform in KASA Show this year. If you haven't told me that you want to be in the KASA Show and you do want to be in the show, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably before this Saturday. And again, please be sure to come to Saturday practices if you want to be in the KASA Show and let me know beforehand if you can not make a Saturday practice.

Lastly, let me know if you're still waiting on a uniform.

This is the show from two years ago (we didn't film last year's show, which is a reeeeeeeeal shame) to get an idea of what a KASA demo looks like.
