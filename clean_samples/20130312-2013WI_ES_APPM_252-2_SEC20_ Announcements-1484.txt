Class,

I'll be holding an office hour today at 3pm, probably in my actual office (M410). If I'm not in there, I'll post a sign on my door directing you where to go.

Prof. Silber has put a practice final exam and solution online. I think it would be useful to try to take this in a timed environment, to give you all an idea of what concepts you need to study/review.

I'll need your input about this. Would you like to

-spend the discussion hour this Thursday taking part of the exam? It's designed to be a two hour exam, so perhaps we can do the first 5-6 problems in 50 minutes? Then we can spend office hours that afternoon discussing things? I don't like how this option breaks the day up.

-skip discussion/office hours this Thursday and instead carve out 3 hours this weekend or on Monday (one day before your real exam) to take the practice exam in full and discuss it afterwards?

-take the exam on your own before Thursday morning and we can go over it in discussion?

-pull problems from the practice final and work them out on the board on Thursday?

If there is anything else you can think of, I can be flexible.

Please respond with what you prefer. I'll need all of you guys to let me know how I can best help you prepare for your final!

Sincerely,

Karna
