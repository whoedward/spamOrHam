Hannah,

Do you remember if you found the cables during a sweep or if was it a clean-up from a previous event? In any case, it seems like someone cleaned the setup without finishing the job.

Dealing with gaff tape can be a pain, but one way that has worked well for me is tearing the gaff tape around the base of the cable where the two sides meet, and then tearing the rest of it off. In any case, if you had to deal with this, then it probably means someone else didn't do their job properly. Thanks for the heads up!
