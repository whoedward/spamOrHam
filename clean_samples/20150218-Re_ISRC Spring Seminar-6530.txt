    GREETINGS ISRC students in need of an Ethics&Values Distro and/or those who just love ethics and values classes!

    Next quarter ISRC will host a seminar (aka an awesome class held in ISRC) led by Professor Claudia Swan.

    The class is dubbed Whose Marbles Are They Anyway? A Brief History of International Cultural Heritage Debates.

    The class is intended for students with an interest in cultural politics, international relations, art history, and the history of museology, enrollment does not presuppose any prior study of any of these subjects and is open to all interested students.

    FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS SEMINAR PLEASE JOIN US FOR CLAUDIA SWAN'S FIRESIDE
    MONDAY AT 9PM IN THE MAIN LOUNGE!

    The aim of this course is to introduce students to pressing issues in cultural heritage and the politics of cultural patrimony. 
    The course is not limited to European cultural heritage claims. 

    Class will most likely be held either Tuesdays 6:30-9 or Wednesdays 6:30-9.

    If you cannot attend the fireside on Monday at 9pm but are interested in knowing more about the class, please contact Rohan Prakash at rohanprakash2017@u.northwestern.edu or me at dalithendel2017@u.northwestern.edu.
