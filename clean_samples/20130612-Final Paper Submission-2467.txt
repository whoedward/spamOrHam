Hello Dr. Roberts,

I am emailing you in regards to the final paper's deadline. In the past week I have had several finals and labs (like most NU students), but in particular I have had the conclusion of my Design Thinking and Communication project. This project is incredibly time-consuming and surprisingly occupying, and ended up distracting me from my other work more than I had expected.

With that said, I would like to ask for a small extension on the due date of the final paper. I realize that you have to have grades submitted before a certain deadline, so I would only like to ask that you allow me until Friday to submit it to you.

Is this okay? Would you be willing to extend the deadline to an earlier time? I apologize for any inconvenience that this might cause you, and have certainly learned a valuable (albeit last minute) lesson on juggling tasks.

Best,
Ethan Robison
