Hey guys, sorry for the late notice but I was just informed of an event that is going on tonight at 8PM in the Forum Room in the library (theatre room that's right up the stairs when you walk through the main entrance).

The event is held by NU's American Sign Language Club and they will be showing a documentary about the controversy over cochlear implants. The movie is called Sound and Fury and it was nominated for an Academy Award.

Sound and Fury
Sound and Fury documents one family's struggle over whether or not to provide two deaf children with cochlear implants, devices that can stimulate hearing. As the Artinians of Long Island, New York debate what is the right choice for the two deaf cousins, Heather, 6, and Peter, 1 Â½, viewers are introduced to one of the most controversial issues affecting the Deaf community today. Cochlear implants may provide easier access to the hearing world, but what do the devices mean for a person's sense of identity with deaf culture? Can durable bridges be built between the deaf and hearing worlds? Find out.


If you attend, lemme know and I'll hook you up with a point.

Thanks,
Kyle
