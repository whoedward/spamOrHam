Hey guys,
If you aren't going to the tournament, then you should totally go to the football game. We're partnered with the Wounded Warrior Project, and this weekend is dedicated to the Veterans of the United States armed forces, complete with themed uniforms, and a patriotic half-time show.

    Hey, everyone,

    I just wanted to let you guys know that there will not be practice this upcoming Saturday because Blomquist will be closed due to a home football game. Hope you guys enjoy the day.
