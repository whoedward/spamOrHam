Hi all,

I hope that everyone is having a great week! For this week's social, I am planning a movie night in the basement this Saturday around 10PM. The current movie list includes the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Pirates of the Caribbean, 27 Dresses, Harry Potter and pretty much any other movie that you guys have and want to watch! There will be Free Food (either wings or milk/cookies or both) and you will get a social point for attending. Please e-mail me to let me know if you are interested in coming so that I know how much food to get. Have a great weekend and I hope to see you on Saturday!

Best,
Danny
