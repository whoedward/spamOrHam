Hi all,
Our next social will be a very very small tour of Lincoln Square- We'll be going to a really cool candy shop (http://www.amyscandybar.com/candy/candy.html) followed by a Vietnamese restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/menu/royal-thai-restaurant-chicago) for dinner. It'll be great, and chill, since I know midterm season was pretty tiring.
We'll be leaving at 5 on Saturday, November 1st, taking the CTA down. This should be enough time for y'all going on the habitat build to come join us. I expect to be back at around 9. Y'all will have to cover your own transportation; it'll just be easier as we'll be bus hopping. Our budget allows for 14 people to come. I'll send out an e-mail this Wednesday, October 28th, at 8pm, so if you want to come, look out for that e-mail.
Hope you all have had a relaxing weekend.

Paul Kim
