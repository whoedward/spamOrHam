Hey everyone,

So it's been a few weeks, but I've finally managed to finish a working prototype for the taekwondo sparring point system thing (short of coming up with a better name). Anyways, it's got buttons and stuff on it. The only difference between this and the final version will be that the final version will have the judge's buttons on a separate controller. I've put in the order for 90 feet of ribbon cable, which should come in the next few days.

Anyways, I'll try and bring it to practice tomorrow and everyone can play around with it.

P.S. I can't upload the new versions to dropbox because I'm way over capacity, and I can't email it because it's an executable so... yeah... :(

P.P.S If this ends up not working out, I wonder what I'm going to do with 90 feet of ribbon cable.
