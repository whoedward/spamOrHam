Hey everyone,

As the notes for this week have indicated, we are going to have a dance party this Saturday in the main lounge from 8pm to whenever. I need all of your help with a very important part of this event. Since my musical knowledge is very limited to Classical music, I need requests for songs you would like to have played at the party. So e-mail me song titles/playlists by this Friday. So far, I have only 2 requests so far, so unless you'd like to listen to "What is Love?" and "Timber" on repeated loops, send me songs!

Thanks,
Thomas
