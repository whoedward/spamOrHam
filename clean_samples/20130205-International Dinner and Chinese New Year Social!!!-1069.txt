Hey everyone!

International Dinner is on Sunday, February 24th. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is an ISRC tradition, and our annual formal. Instead of buying a ticket, you make an international dish (that serves 10) by yourself or with a friend! We don't want you to spend any money on it, so in the next couple of weeks I need you to send me your dish name, partner and your recipe and I'll buy the ingredients and give them to you.

Get thinking, I need your recipes by February 17th. Email me with any questions and don't worry, I'll definitely be emailing about this again. :)

Also, we will be having Lunar New Year dumpling social this Sunday, February 10th. Join us in the main lounge after Open Exec to make and eat dumplings! Feel free to help out by putting up some decorations; Exec will be in the main lounge sometime on Saturday, details to come.
